Perhaps, you are already using both of them actively. So, you know what these platforms are. But do you know on which platform you have more chance of becoming an influencer?</p><h2>Instagram vs. TikTok</h2><p>Instagram has been around since before there were any influencers. It’s as old as hills. TikTok, on the other hand, can still be considered brand new. So the question is, which one is better for you? Before we start to look at the facts, you should know that both of these platforms have massive audiences for your content. I’m talking about more than 500 million daily users. I believe you understand the magnitude of these platforms. Now, let’s get into details.</p><p>It’s a fact that users are spending more time on TikTok than Instagram. So, you can interpret that you have more chance on TikTok since it will be easier to reach the audience. Also, as I said earlier, Instagram is an older platform than TikTok. Its users are mostly the same. But TikTok is getting new users every day. This can make you more prone to choose TikTok over Instagram.</p><p>Since Instagram is an old and powerful platform, it is known and used by a lot of influencers. TikTok is only used by a tiny percentage of these influencers, meaning the competition on Instagram is higher than TikTok. So which one makes sense to you? Instagram where the competition is high or TikTok where you have more opportunities?</p><p>Although both of these platforms mostly have young audiences, their age varies. If we compare Instagram and Tiktok users’ age, I can say that TikTok has a younger audience. It includes Gen Z & Alpha in addition to millennials. And Instagram is actively used by people in their twenties. By looking at the profile of your audience, you can easily decide which platform you have more chance on.</p><h2>TikTok and Instagram Strategies</h2><p>Although TikTok and Instagram serve the same purposes as a social media platform, their strategies are not the same. While considering the facts above, you should also know these apps’ strategies and make your decision accordingly. Let’s look at some of the strategies you can implement on these platforms to be an influencer. <span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Check out this post"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":961,"3":{"1":0},"9":0,"10":1,"11":4,"12":0}'>Check out <strong><a href=#>this</a></strong> post</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/inflownetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tiktok.jpg alt="TikTok vs Instagram: Where Do You Have More Chance?" width=750 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>The Influencer Strategy for TikTok</h3><p>Thanks to a research done by <span><a href=# rel=noopener>MediaUpdate</a></span>, we can get to know TikTok users better. According to the research, watching TikTok videos became a hobby for most of the people. They entertain themselves on the app, scrolling down an endless amount of videos. And they don’t want to be disturbed while they are viewing TikToks. There is no fixed prime time on the platform, any time of the day is a prime time for users. This is why people are spending so much time on TikTok without getting bored. The content is always fresh.</p><p>So, now you know what kind of an audience you have on TikTok. Let’s see what kind of a strategy you can use to become a TikTok influencer.</p><ul><li>The trends are changing in a heartbeat on TikTok and you need to keep up with them while you are creating your content.</li><li>Your content should be original because there are too many others.</li><li>Challenges are appreciated.
