Growing up in Manhattan, De Niro’s earliest introduction to the arts was during his youth in various school productions, his very first role being the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard of Oz at the age of 10. Thanks to his mother and father’s involvement in the arts, De Niro always felt encouraged and supported in his artistic endeavors.</p><p>“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">They would never tell me no</a>,” De Niro told Interview Magazine in 1993. “My mother worked for a woman, Maria Ley-Piscator, who with her husband founded the Dramatic Workshop, which was connected to the New School. My mother did proofreading and typing and stuff for her, and as part of her payment, I was able to take acting classes there on Saturdays when I was 10,” he recalled.&nbsp;</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The young Robert De Niro paves his own path</h2><p>His study of acting continued well into his teenage years, working with Stella Adler at the Conservatory of Acting and then later, at the Actor’s Studio, but not before dropping out of high school at 16 so he could fully devote himself to his craft. De Niro’s earliest credited roles came in Three Rooms in Manhattan (1965), Encounter (1965) and Young Wolves (1968).</p><p>Throughout the decades that followed, De Niro acted both on the screen and the stage. The year of 1968 brought him a starring role in Greetings, and films such as The Wedding Party (1969), Sam’s Song (1969) and Bloody Mama (1970) before briefly taking to the stage in 1972.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-3232401-e1706036411370.jpg><p>In 1973, he starred in Bang the Drum Slowly, and soon after came his pivotal role in The Godfather Part II, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Two years later came another one of his acclaimed roles in Taxi Driver, working with director <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Scorsese</a> for the second time, after collaborating with him in the 1973 film Mean Streets. Later collaborations throughout the 70s and 80s included New York, New York (1977) alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Liza Minelli</a> and Raging Bull (1980), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor.</p><p><strong>MUST-READ: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cybill Shepherd Movies and TV Shows: A Guide to the Blonde Beauty’s Most Beloved Roles</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-526898082-e1706036504262.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Robert De Niro’s career throughout the 80s</h2><p>De Niro had already established himself as a successful and accomplished actor by the 1980s, and the decade gave us films like The King of Comedy (1982), where he showed off his comedic side in the wake of more serious films, as well as Falling in Love (1984), Brazil (1985) and Jacknife (1989).
