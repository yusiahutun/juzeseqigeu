After she teamed Adidas Stan Smiths – originally designed in the mid 1960s – with a roll neck and slim black trousers in 2010, the tennis shoe became a stalwart trend with women for the following decade. As did tucking one’s long hair into the aforementioned roll neck.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Inside luxury fashion’s love affair with cinema, beyond the red carpet</span></p></a></h3>After years of male creative directors making clothes that <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">looked fantastic on a catwalk</span></a> or in a magazine, but which were not always easy to wear in day-to-day life, the British designer prioritised pieces one wanted to buy the next day. “What women loved about her work at Celine was that she was clearly designing with herself in mind, and who wouldn’t want to look as casually chic as Phoebe Philo?” asks Rochelle.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/19/5693e032-176d-4ac9-8fe2-270ac20cc3c9_6114a0af.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This translated into instant commercial success, and by the time Philo’s tenure at Celine came to an end, she had quadrupled sales to an impressive €800 million (US$846 million) per year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/19/75332c5f-22f4-4024-905b-5e2ffe413133_4c6a004f.jpg>Interestingly, the look she pioneered was never showy. She was known <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">for her minimalist designs</span></a> that hung perfectly – the beautifully cut trousers; the perfect jacket; the dream coat. But at the same time she elevated pieces like those Stan Smiths or like Birkenstocks (which she used in a fashionable way for the first time) into a whole new sphere.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Meet Chris Rock’s fashionista daughters, Lola Simone and Zahra Savannah</span></p></a></h3>Philo was also conscious of speaking to all women – not just perfect-looking twenty-somethings. She often talked about <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">being proud of getting older</span></a> and while at Celine she cast a then 80-year-old Joan Didion in a 2015 campaign. She was also one of the first creative directors at a major fashion house to take a proper maternity leave – and wasn’t shy to talk to the press about it.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/19/64e5e952-ca1f-455e-9a38-6c0312facbcd_99f3d7e3.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For all these reasons and many more, women felt profoundly connected to Philo – and so it has been with bated breath that the fashion community has awaited news of her return. And the wait has been longer than expected, as Philo took four years out to spend time with her art dealer husband and her two children.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now though, there are mere weeks until her new label lands, with a release date of October 30 confirmed. The collection will consist of 150 pieces of clothing and accessories sold via phoebephilo.com.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Being in my studio and making once again has been both exciting and incredibly fulfilling,” said the London-based designer in a statement. “I am very much looking forward to being back in touch with my audience and people everywhere.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/19/9e3260e6-53b7-44a6-a8ba-bf0ec0d7cb9f_53c54583.jpg><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">French luxury group LVMH</span></a> has taken a minority stake in the new venture, which means Philo should have free reign on the direction it takes, something that was very important to her. “To be independent, to govern and experiment on my own terms is hugely significant to me,” she said in the same statement – giving some indication as to why she never took on any of the major roles she was touted for, including replacing Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">12 of Victoria and David Beckham’s most memorable couple looks ever</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/19/bd7cffa1-1279-4839-9fbb-2415739e7e5b_4c6a004f.jpg>In the meantime, excitement over the upcoming launch means sales of her old collections have skyrocketed once again.
