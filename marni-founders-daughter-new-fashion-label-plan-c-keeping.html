It turns out they were wrong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was a pity to leave everything behind – all the knowledge, the people that had worked with us from manufacturers to laboratories. We decided to start again but in our own way,” says Carolina, Consuelo’s daughter and the founder of the family’s latest venture, a fashion brand aptly named Plan C. “I wanted to start small – we only have 25 people working for the company, and yes, that team includes my brother and father.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is no Consuelo in sight this time around, making Carolina the boss – creatively speaking, at least.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s only natural that people will compare Plan C to Marni, but it is its own entity. Of course from the outside it is obvious I have inherited certain tastes and styles from my mother, but Plan C is also very distinctive and contemporary. It’s a new chapter of the story in a way,” she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/06/81aa08e0-0cd9-11ea-afcd-7b308be3ba45_972x_054410.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Carolina Castiglioni studied fashion business at the Istituto Marangoni before joining Marni in 2005, where she worked in various departments including retail, e-commerce and special projects. Her role at Plan C is quite different – as creative director she is responsible for overseeing all the collections, which she creates together with the product design team.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The label launched in September 2018 with plenty of buzz, due in part to the family connection. While it shared many characteristics with Marni, the look is more polished and pragmatic – eccentric but definitely less artsy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Carolina’s personal style is also evident throughout the collections, which she says speak to women who “have a strong creative spirit regardless of their age”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The collections mix different elements together – be it colours or patterns. They may seem odd at first but when you put them together they are special. Quality of fabrics is also very important, so I spend a lot of time researching and sourcing from Italy and Japan. The silhouette is usually oversized, and I like to reference menswear and workwear. The look is feminine in a creative way, but far from classic,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This is evident in the spring/summer 2020 collection, which features bomber jackets made from canvas and eco-leather, menswear-inspired plaid jackets and pencil skirts, and a full-length duchesse satin trench coat covered in a festive floral print.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/06/d5e5f63a-0cd9-11ea-afcd-7b308be3ba45_972x_054410.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other highlights include the tailored shirts, which come with detachable knit collars in contrasting colours, and canvas- coated bags that feature playful stick drawings by Carolina’s daughter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Accessories seem to be a big hit, so more bag styles have been added this season, ranging from constructed leather cross-body designs to drawstring totes and colour-block satchels available in eco-leather.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although the brand is still young and the offerings are limited – there are only two collections a year featuring 200 pieces – it is expanding steadily. It is now stocked by more than 140 outlets worldwide, including Lane Crawford in Hong Kong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/06/f52543ca-0cd9-11ea-afcd-7b308be3ba45_972x_054410.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Earlier this Plan C welcomed its first boutique in Tokyo operated by local partners. Another will open in Korea in January with Samsung. Pop-ups are planned in cities including Paris and London, and e-commerce is next, although there are no plans to build a free-standing retail network.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We want to grow little by little but it’s not about building another Marni. Keeping it small is our way of being sustainable,” Carolina says. “More importantly, it means you can do more things and work instinctively. That’s the best advice my mum gave me.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“She told me not to follow what other people do or say, and believe in my own ability,” she says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlkpqutsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kmlraW1jaXyurdGnoGaen6q7pbHRrGSdmaWctbWx0Walnq9dm660tMiopWakkZeyrXnPpZinZZNiuKaxz6KloA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./spanx-perfect-pant-black-friday-2022-6832485.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Spanxs Perfect Black Wide-Leg Pants Are a Wardrobe Staple</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./maria-aprilyn-marquinez.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Maria Aprilyn Marquinez</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
