Mitch, who also identifies as an actor, has performed in various movies including Pitch Perfect 2 (2015), Bones (2005) and has also appeared in the famous talk show The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Moving aside his professional career, John also has a gushing married life. But who is&nbsp;the&nbsp;lucky one? Let's talk about the romantic persona of&nbsp; Mitch along with other personal details!</p><h2>Openly Gay, In A Relationship?</h2><p>Mitch has been living an openly gay life and it seems like he has a romantic partner, whom he can identify as a loving husband.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, Mitch's beau is non-other than his bandmate Scott Hoying and they have known each other for a long time. The two first met at a theatre&nbsp;in Arlington, Texas, while performing their first lay together, Annie. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Although they got separated attending different schools, Mitch and Scott were reunited after about a year and a half.</p><p>When asked about his first impression of Scott, Mitch revealed in an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Billboard on 21 June 20, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>&nbsp;I remember thinking Scott was really, really funny and very enthusiastic.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Mitch further went on to reveal that the two were comfortable in each other's company and even though they were both hiding in the closet at that time, both Mitch and Scott subconsciously knew that they were both gay.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Mitch and Scott, who co-hosts&nbsp;the Youtube channel Sup3rfruit,&nbsp;have never identified each other as boyfriends. Further, they only describe each other as best friends, however, looking at their pictures together it's hard to say that they are not dating.&nbsp;</p><p>On 30 October 2014, a Youtube&nbsp;account named KayCey Ray uploaded a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">video</a> of them cuddling together. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Moreover, Mitch also uploaded a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">picture</a> on his Twitter on 9 May 2017, where the two could be seen posing bare-chested and hugging each other.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Mitch and Scott spend time together&nbsp;at&nbsp;the beach on 9 May 2017</strong> (Photo: Mitch Grassi's Instagram)</p><p>Mitch and Scott are also known to address each other as "spouse" even though they are not officially married. On 24 July 2017, in reply to a tweet, Mitch introduced Scott as his husband via a post.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Mitch identifies Scott as his husband on 24 July 2017</strong>&nbsp;(Photo: Mitch's and Scott's Twitter)</p><p>Mitch and Scott have never confirmed about their dating status. Mitch, who enjoys a net worth of $8 million, has not revealed much about his relationship with his male friend in the recent days. But&nbsp;hopefully, in the near future, the couple will tie the knot and finally pronounce each other as husband and husband.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqahpJi1brPRmqqsoV2crrp5zJqpq6GVmXqpwdKbmKecXZe8urLRopynnF2ZrrW1zaBloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./racing-queen-princess-mary-storms-ahead-contestants-one-mile-royal-run-nyborg-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Princess Mary of Denmark takes part in Royal Run with Crown Prince Frederik in Nyborg</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mashed-potato-bar-recipe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mashed Potato Bar: How To Turn This Side Into a Party Dish</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
