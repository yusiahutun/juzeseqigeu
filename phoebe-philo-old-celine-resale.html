A lot has changed in that half-decade, in both the world at large and the world of fashion. A lot. (Even Celine lost its acute accent). But the level of passion for Philo-era Céline is not one of them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When she departed, Philophiles the world over pledged their allegiance to ‘Old Céline’ – the affectionate moniker that has come to denote her decade-long tenure at the brand – some by following fan accounts set up on Instagram, many by snapping up anything they could with Philo’s design handwriting on it before it was too late. Sales of secondhand Old Céline surged – and never stopped. In fact, since Philo announced that her new brand would launch this September, searches for 'Old Céline' have surged 70 per cent on Ebay. It's a phenomenon completely at odds with the churn of the fashion cycle; the old coveted over the new.</p><img alt="france celine paris fashion week womenswear springsummer 2015" title="France - Celine - Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Spring/Summer 2015" width=3280 height=4928 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/model-walks-the-runway-during-the-celine-show-as-part-of-news-photo-1681290681.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Stephane Cardinale - Corbis</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Highlights from the autumn/winter 2023 shows" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/kendall-jenner-vittoria-ceretti-rianne-van-rompaey-gigi-news-photo-1678470005-6410a0e9d2a71.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But why? Undoubtedly, her ability to design as a woman for women carries heft. To create pieces that gave practicality and beauty equal billing, pieces that were refreshingly devoid of the male gaze. “Fashion was very different before she started at Celine,” says Sabrina Marshall, co-founder of luxury resale site <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.resee.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Re-See class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Re-See</a>, on which Old Céline ranks in the top three most-wanted brands. “She changed the fashion landscape. She knew how to balance making us dream with the reality of how a modern woman really dresses. She'll go down in history, the same way that Yves Saint Laurent did for starting ready-to-wear and liberating women.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Erica Wright, founder of fashion sourcing app <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.sourcewhere.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Sourcewhere class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Sourcewhere</a>, agrees: “The collections were always inspiring but with a sense of practicality, especially at a time when there were fewer brands focusing on designing pieces that could be worn from the school run to meetings and then to a dinner date.” At Sourcewhere, it is the most requested brand for past-season finds.</p><img alt="france celine rtw fw 201314" title="France - Celine - RTW F/W 2013/14" width=2832 height=4248 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/model-walks-the-runway-during-the-celine-fall-winter-2013-news-photo-1681290946.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Stephane Cardinale - Corbis</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So who are the women fuelling the red-hot secondhand circuit? Perhaps predictably, primarily professional women between 30 and 60. One such customer is <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/lafredtouch/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Frédérique Gilain-Huneeus" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Frédérique Gilain-Huneeus</a>, a chief legal officer at an Asia-based hedge fund, who started building her collection in real time and then continued via the resale market when Philo left in 2018. Though she’s never counted – “when you love, you don’t count, do you?” – she thinks she owns somewhere in the region of 300 Old Céline pieces: “Perhaps more of the accessories, bags and shoes.” Her most recent purchase was a navy open-back ribbed dress from the autumn/winter 2015 collection.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What’s more interesting is the lower end of the demographic, which is made up of women who didn’t – or couldn’t – buy it the first time round, like <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/yana_mckillop/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Yana McKillop" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Yana McKillop</a>, a stylist and fashion editor. “I was making the first steps in my career when Phoebe started at Celine and owning something from it was an unachievable dream at that stage,” she explains, “but it embodied a vision of a woman I wanted to be.” She has since built up a substantial personal archive and occasionally sources and sells Old Céline too via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/yanasarchive/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@yanasarchive class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@yanasarchive</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That the designs still resonate as clearly now as they did when they were fresh off the catwalk is perhaps the ultimate testament to Old Céline’s ability to withstand the test of time. But if the cost was prohibitive when it was new, it’s often even more so now. This is rare – we think of resale as an avenue to get things at a more affordable price, but according to Marshall, Old Céline has the potential to hit Hermès bag levels when it comes to investability (Hermès bags are famously one of the only luxury items on the market that appreciate in value). Aside from the enduring aesthetic appeal, the quality of Old Céline is such that pieces have the potential to have an incredibly long lifespan, explains Marshall.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At Sourcewhere, items often outstrip their original retail price, with classic bags – including the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.vestiairecollective.com/women-bags/celine/trapeze/#brand=Celine%236" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Trapeze data-vars-ga-product-id=3afaa581-5ffb-405f-9d98-09014faeab22 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://www.vestiairecollective.com/women-bags/celine/trapeze/#brand=Celine%236" data-product-url="https://www.vestiairecollective.com/women-bags/celine/trapeze/#brand=Celine%236" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vestiairecollective.com%2Fwomen-bags%2Fceline%2Ftrapeze%2F%23brand%3DCeline%236" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=celine data-vars-ga-product-price=$550.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=8cb78f42-344f-4110-ae50-8813ebcfcfae data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=celine class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Trapeze</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.vestiairecollective.com/women-bags/celine/cabas/#brand=Celine%236" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Cabas data-vars-ga-product-id=b22fb400-b202-48e7-879f-9a06da535989 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://www.vestiairecollective.com/women-bags/celine/cabas/#brand=Celine%236" data-product-url="https://www.vestiairecollective.com/women-bags/celine/cabas/#brand=Celine%236" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vestiairecollective.com%2Fwomen-bags%2Fceline%2Fcabas%2F%23brand%3DCeline%236" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=vestiairecollective.com data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=33f14023-732a-498a-8455-58626ac6eeb0 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=vestiairecollective.com class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Cabas</a> – and pull-on sneakers known to fetch high prices.

Sourcers continually find it hard to track down and it very rarely appears on resale sites. If it does come up for sale, the price tag is huge (one has previously sold on peer-to-peer marketplace Grailed.com for over $5,000) and it sells instantly. For Gilain-Huneeus it’s the piece she most regrets not buying first time round. “The price for this piece on the secondhand market is unreasonable in my opinion – I have the matching trousers though and I am very happy with them!” With a finite amount of Old Céline in the world, it’s the scarcity principle in action.</p><img alt="celine runway paris fashion week springsummer 2011" title="Celine - Runway Paris Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2011" width=4896 height=3264 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/model-walks-the-runway-during-the-celine-ready-to-wear-news-photo-1681291487.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Michel Dufour</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>The Foulard shirt on the catwalk</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Martina Lohoff is one such sourcer who has been challenged to find the Foulard shirt. A design technology and economics instructor from Dortmund, she started collecting Celine in 2013 and set up <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/thearchivedotcom/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Old Céline Archive" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Old Céline Archive</a> in 2020 as a platform to source and sell the rarest pieces via Instagram. She now has 30,000 dedicated followers tracking her discoveries and last year joined forces with Re-See to hold an exclusive sale of 200 archive pieces during Paris Fashion Week, which fashion insiders were “fighting to come to”, according to Marshall. She’s most regularly tasked with finding the Yves Klein ‘Anthropometrie’ dress and another with spider web bra detailing, both from spring/summer 2017, and a blanket from Philo’s final collection, created in collaboration with graphic designer Peter Miles. But even she hasn’t been able to track down a porcelain-detail choker from the cruise 2016 collection… yet: “I was told it was only shown in the lookbook and never made it into the boutiques.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But what of the thrill, or lack thereof, of buying such prized items from behind a screen as opposed to a polished store? “As Céline was never sold online when it was under Phoebe, it was always a bit of a sacred ritual to go to the store and see and feel the pieces,” says Yana McKillop. “(But) I would say there’s definitely more thrill when you hunt down that piece you’ve been looking for for years in some cases.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What’s most clear is that the women buying Old Céline are buying it to be worn – from statement pieces to classic, everyday knitwear – not just to simply own it. “I don’t envision my ‘collection’ as one to be kept in a safe; I wear all of my pieces, every day; they are a part of me somehow,” says Frédérique Gilain-Huneeus. After all, it was the real-life wearability of Old Céline that resonated so deeply with women in the first place – and if the bubbling trend for ‘quiet luxury’ is anything to go by, it seems Philo’s design sensibilities are coming very much back into focus, just in time for her grand return.</p><img alt="celine runway paris fashion week womenswear springsummer 2016" title="Celine : Runway - Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Spring/Summer 2016" width=4256 height=2833 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/model-walks-the-runway-during-the-celine-ready-to-wear-show-news-photo-1681291807.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor Virgile</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSudX%2BUcGpsamdkvam7xJucZqiYnrmwec6lm2ablaG2r7GMq5ysmZyafA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./johnny-depp-vanessa-paradis-split.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Did Johnny Depp, Vanessa Paradis Split?
