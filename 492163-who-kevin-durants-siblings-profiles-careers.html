This means that Kevin Durant is 34 years old as of 2023.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, Kevin's father left when he was an infant, and Durant was raised by his grandmother, Barabara Davis.</p><p class=align-left>Kevin grew up in Prince George's County, Maryland, on the eastern outskirts of Washington, D.C. The <a href=#>basketball player</a> was unusually tall from a young age and was often teased for his height by schoolmates. The good thing is that he found a place where he could use his height – the basketball court.</p><p class=align-left>Kevin's father re-entered his son's life when he was 13 years old and travelled all over the country with him to basketball tournaments. Durant and Tony were quite close as they bonded over basketball when they were toddlers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b157c01d17a674d4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Michael Tell?

He even played for the University of Texas at Austin. Today, Durant plays for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association, where he has made notable achievements.</p><h2>Kevin Durant’s siblings</h2><p class=align-left>How many siblings does Kevin Durant have? It is public that Kevin Durant isn’t the only child as he has siblings. He is the eldest of four siblings in his family.</p><p class=align-left>Who are Kevin Durant’s sisters and brothers? Kevin <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">has two brothers</a> and a younger sister. The most popular among Kevin Durant’s siblings is Anthony “Tony” Durant. He has an active <a href=#>social media</a> presence and has appeared in interviews where he talks about his brother. The other lesser-known siblings are Brianna and Rayvonne Pratt.</p><h3>Tony Durant</h3><p class=align-left>People have always wondered, “Does Kevin Durant have brothers?” Tony Durant is the oldest of four siblings, and he was born on January 6, 1986, in Suitland, Maryland, the United States of America. He attended Suitland <a href=#>High School</a> in Forestville, Maryland, and St. John's Military School in Salina, Kansas, where he finished his high school education.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2c9dcf624e0d4a80.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Is NBA Youngboy in jail? Here's everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The most interesting thing is that Tony is also a <a href=#>talented basketballer</a> like his brother, Kevin Durant. He played basketball for a while and is close to his brother, often talking about him during interviews.</p><p class=align-left>Tony Durant is a proud father of two sons, Jaydn Harris and Deuce, who is four years old. The most exciting thing is that Tony's eldest son, Jadyn is already interested in professional basketball, like his father and uncle. He often posts photos and videos of his games on his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram page</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Tony and Kevin Durant have maintained a tight bond since they were children, regardless of their differences. In 2020, Tony shared a touching birthday tribute for this brother, expressing love.</p><h3>Rayvonne Pratt</h3><p class=align-left>Rayvonne Pratt is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">younger brother</a> of Kevin Durant. He was born and raised in Washington, D.C., just like Kevin. Unlike Kevin and their elder sibling, Tony, Rayvonne leads a private and quiet life and hasn’t had a public image for a long time. That is why not much is known about him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dee68a85427567d6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is Luke James sexuality and who is the singer dating?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>People have been wondering why Rayvonne uses his paternal family name, unlike his elder siblings, who use Durant. According to various reports, Wayne Pratt, his father, abandoned the family when Kevin Durant was just nine months old. Therefore, Wanda, Kevin's mother, had to take care of the family and promoted Kevin and Tony to adopt Durant instead of Pratt.</p><p class=align-left>Years later, Wayne Pratt returned to his family, which led to Wayne getting other children, Rayvonne and Brianna, who adopted his name.</p><h3>Brianna Pratt</h3><p class=align-left>Brianna Pratt is the youngest sibling in the family, and like his brother, Rayvonne, little is known about her. She is also not active on social media and prefers to live a private life.</p><h2>What happened to Kevin Durant’s brother?</h2><p class=align-left>Clifford Dixon, who Kevin Durant considered his "adopted brother", was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">fatally shot</a> outside a metro Atlanta bar in 2019. Police reports stated that Clifford arrived at the location for a birthday celebration and was standing in the parking lot when he was shot.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8b776b3238bd11cb.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Elizabeth Anderson Martin?

Our family was an extension of his, and we shared wonderful memories. His transition is an incredible loss for all of us who loved him. He will be missed dearly. #CliffDixon RIP.<h2>Are Kevin Durant and Decobie Durant related?</h2><p class=align-left>Kevin and Decobie Durant have the same second name, and people have been wondering whether they are related. Kevin created even more confusion when he went to Twitter to discuss their relationship.</p><p class=align-left>Kevin was joking on Twitter when he mentioned that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Decobie was his cousin</a>.
