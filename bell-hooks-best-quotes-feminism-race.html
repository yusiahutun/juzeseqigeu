Her works, including Ain’t I a Woman: Black Women and Feminism, All About Love, Bone Black, Feminist Theory and Communion: The Female Search for Love, were beacons for a generation of writers and thinkers in academia and beyond.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Here’s a handful of her most memorable quotes:</p><h2 id=on-love><strong>On love:</strong></h2><p>The one person who will never leave us, whom we will never lose, is ourself. Learning to love our female selves is where our search for love must begin.<br>– Communion: The Search for Female Love, 2002</p><p>But many of us seek community solely to escape the fear of being alone. Knowing how to be solitary is central to the art of loving. When we can be alone, we can be with others without using them as a means of escape.<br>– All About Love: New Visions, 1999</p><p>The moment we choose to love we begin to move against domination, against oppression. The moment we choose to love we begin to move towards freedom, to act in ways that liberate ourselves and others.<br>– Outlaw Culture: Resisting Representations, 1994</p><h2 id=on-community><strong>On community:</strong></h2><p>To build community requires vigilant awareness of the work we must continually do to undermine all the socialization that leads us to behave in ways that perpetuate domination.<br>– Teaching Community: A Pedagogy of Hope, 2003</p><p>Dominator culture has tried to keep us all afraid, to make us choose safety instead of risk, sameness instead of diversity. Moving through that fear, finding out what connects us, reveling in our differences; this is the process that brings us closer, that gives us a world of shared values, of meaningful community.<br>– Teaching Community: A Pedagogy of Hope, 2003</p><h2 id=on-feminism><strong>On feminism:</strong></h2><p>It is obvious that many women have appropriated feminism to serve their own ends, especially those white women who have been at the forefront of the movement; but rather than resigning myself to this appropriation I choose to re-appropriate the term ‘feminism’, to focus on the fact that to be ‘feminist’ in any authentic sense of the term is to want for all people, female and male, liberation from sexist role patterns, domination, and oppression.<br>– Ain’t I A Woman: Black Women and Feminism, 1981</p><p>If any female feels she need anything beyond herself to legitimate and validate her existence, she is already giving away her power to be self-defining, her agency.<br>– Feminism is for Everybody: Passionate Politics, 2000</p><p>No Black woman writer in this culture can write ‘too much’. Indeed, no woman writer can write ‘too much’ … No woman has ever written enough.”<br>– Remembered Rapture: The Writer At Work, 1999</p><figure id=a0165556-24ec-4d5b-b91f-cef30853b362 data-spacefinder-role=supporting data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-a2pvoh><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span> Photograph: Anthony Barboza/Getty Images</figure><p>We continue to put in place the anti-sexist thinking and practice which affirms the reality that females can achieve self-actualization and success without dominating one another.”<br>– Feminism is for Everybody: Passionate Politics, 2000</p><h2 id=on-racism-and-white-supremacy><strong>On racism and white supremacy:</strong></h2><p>Marginality [is] much more than a site of deprivation. In fact I was saying just the opposite: that it is also the site of radical possibility, a space of resistance.<br>– <a href=#>Marginality As a Site of Resistance</a>, 1990</p><p>Understanding marginality as position and place of resistance is crucial for oppressed, exploited, colonized people. If we only view the margin as sign, marking the condition of our pain and deprivation, then a certain hopelessness and despair, a deep nihilism penetrates in a destructive way the very ground of our being. It is there in that space of collective despair that one’s creativity, one’s imagination is at risk, there that one’s mind is fully colonized, there that the freedom one longs for is lost.<br>– Marginality as a Site of Resistance, 1990</p><p>All our silences in the face of racist assault are acts of complicity.<br>– Killing Rage: Ending Racism, 1995</p><p>We can’t combat white supremacy unless we can teach people to love justice. You have to love justice more than your allegiance to your race, sexuality and gender. It is about justice.<br>- <a href=#>interview</a> with Jet Magazine, 2013</p><h2 id=on-patriarchy><strong>On patriarchy:</strong></h2><p>The first act of violence that patriarchy demands of males is not violence toward women. Instead patriarchy demands of all males that they engage in acts of psychic self-mutilation, that they kill off the emotional parts of themselves. If an individual is not successful in emotionally crippling himself, he can count on patriarchal men to enact rituals of power that will assault his self-esteem.<br>– The Will To Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love, 2004</p><p>I still think it’s important for people to have a sharp, ongoing critique of marriage in patriarchal society – because once you marry within a society that remains patriarchal, no matter how alternative you want to be within your unit, there is still a culture outside you that will impose many, many values on you whether you want them to or not.<br>– Feminism is For Everybody: Passionate Politics, 2000</p><h2 id=on-forgiveness-and-hope><strong>On forgiveness and hope:</strong></h2><p>For me, forgiveness and compassion are always linked: how do we hold people accountable for wrongdoing and yet at the same time remain in touch with their humanity enough to believe in their capacity to be transformed?<br>– <a href=#>in conversation</a> with Maya Angelou, 1998</p><p>The function of art is to do more than tell it like it is – it’s to imagine what is possible.<br>– Outlaw Culture: Resisting Representations, 2012</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJqfpLi0e5FpaWpnlJqwcH2UaJmepJxitbC7yqxkm52jqXqywc6tnKxllpq6qrrIrKRmqpGYsg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./joe-theismann-wiki-wife-height-net-worth-career.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Joe Theismann- Wiki, Wife, Height, Net Worth, Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-saddle-bags.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>23 Best Saddle Bags for Women in 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
