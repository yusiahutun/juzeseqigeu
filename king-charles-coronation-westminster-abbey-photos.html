This was followed by the ancient hymn Veni Creator Spiritus, which was sung in languages from across the United Kingdom, and called on the Holy Spirit. Then came the most sacred part of the coronation rite: the anointing with holy oil that marks the King as chosen and set apart by God.</p><p id=ekqb6D5rDGb data-wc=74>A screen then shielded the King from view as his ceremonial robe was removed and he took his seat in the ancient coronation chair, which was placed on the Cosmati Pavement facing the High Altar. During the anointing, the Choir sang Handel’s famous anthem, Zadok the Priest, which draws on words from 1 Kings 1 and was composed for the coronation of George II in 1727.

He will use the golden eagle-shaped ampulla and the 12th-century silver-gilt anointing spoon to anoint the King in the form of a cross.Charles' chrism oil was made sacred in Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The oil was declared by the Patriarch of Jerusalem, His Beatitude Patriarch Theophilos III, and the Anglican Archbishop in Jerusalem, The Most Reverend Hosam Naoum.It's based on the same recipe used for Queen Elizabeth II and contains notes of rose, jasmine, cinnamon, orange blossom, sesame, benzoin and amber.</p><h2>The coronation ceremony begins</h2><p id=eqGtzE7CsFu data-wc=32>The King and Queen took their seats before the high altar of the Abbey at 11am.
