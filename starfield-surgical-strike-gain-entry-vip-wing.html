Once you speak with Ari again, you’ll discover that he has found another potential suspect, Catalina Rivera, currently in the VIP Wing.</p><p>But to gain entry to the VIP Wing in Starfield, you must persuade Titus Cassidy to give you the keycard or steal it from him. Read on if you want to learn more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=How_To_Unlock_the_VIP_Wing_in_Starfield>How To Unlock the VIP Wing in Starfield</span></h2><p>The first method to gain entry to the VIP Wing of The Clinic is to persuade Dr. Titus Cassidy and obtain the keycard from him.</p><p>To find Dr. Titus Cassidy, proceed towards the left side of The Clinic’s entrance and enter the corridor marked as “Staff Area”.</p><p>Upon reaching the Staff Area, you can find Dr. Cassidy’s office on the hallway’s left side.</p><p>However, Dr. Cassidy is known to move around frequently. If you can’t find him in his office, try checking the nearby kitchen and storage areas.</p><p>Once you find him, speak with him until the dialogue option, “[Persuade] Just hear me out for a minute,” comes up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starfield-gain-entry-to-the-VIP-Wing-dr-titus-cassidy-persuade-1024x576.jpg><p>If you decide to persuade Dr. Cassidy to grant you access to the VIP Wing, you must earn 6 Persuasion Points in three turns to obtain the VIP Wing Keycard from him.</p><p>But suppose you have unlocked the Medicine Skill. In that case, you’ll have access to an additional dialogue option, “[Medicine] I give you my word as a fellow medical professional that I’ll be very discreet.”</p><p>Picking the [Medicine] dialogue option will 100% guarantee you receive the VIP Wing Keycard from him.</p><p>In case you fail the Persuasion scenario or don’t have the [Medicine] dialogue option available, there is an alternative way to enter the VIP Wing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Starfield_VIP_Wing_Keycard_Locations_in_Surgical_Strike_Mission>Starfield VIP Wing Keycard Locations in Surgical Strike Mission</span></h2><p>You can get hold of one of the two VIP Wing Keycards by either taking the one carried by Dr. Titus Cassidy or opening the safe behind his desk where the second keycard is kept.</p><p>The VIP Wing Keycard stored in Dr. Cassidy’s safe is, without a doubt, the safest keycard to steal.</p><p>Wait for Titus Cassidy to leave his office before attempting to open the safe with a Novice Level lock using a Digipick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starfield-gain-entry-to-the-VIP-Wing-keycard-location-safe-1024x576.jpg><p>If you do not have a Digipick, you can find one on the couch across from Dr. Cassidy’s desk.</p><p>Once the safe has been successfully unlocked, quickly grab all the items and leave his office to avoid being caught.</p><p>The second VIP Wing Keycard is more dangerous to steal because Dr. Cassidy carries it. Also, you must have at least 1 Skill point in the Theft Skill to steal the keycard from his pockets.</p><p>Then, you’ll have to sneak up behind him and pickpocket him without anyone noticing. It’s pretty challenging to succeed since the Clinic is filled with doctors and nurses everywhere.</p><p>If you are thinking of killing Dr. Cassidy and looting the keycard from his corpse, don’t bother. He will enter a downed state upon dealing the fatal blow, where you can’t loot him. Also, there is a high chance you’ll turn the whole clinic hostile.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=How_To_Search_for_Clues_in_the_VIP_Wing_in_Starfield>How To Search for Clues in the VIP Wing in Starfield</span></h2><p>After you obtain the VIP Wing Keycard through persuasion or stealing from Dr. Cassidy, unlock the two doors and deal with the hacked turret, then follow the quest marker in the room ahead.</p><p>Before you enter the room, watch out for the mines planted in the doorway.</p><p>After they blow up, search the table next to the hospital bed, where you will find a slate titled “Urgent – Read Immediately.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starfield-gain-entry-to-the-VIP-Wing-urgent-read-immediately-1024x576.jpg><p>This slate contains information that Maya Cruz fled to her hideout in the Abandoned Asteroid Mine at Sakharov.</p><p>To find the second clue, access the Modified Terminal in the room and follow these steps: [Command Override Mode] -> [Disable Program] – [Patient Terminal] – [Terminal Access Logs] – [1st C.
