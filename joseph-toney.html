Hearty NBA centers immediately learned to try to foul O’Neal rather than give him an open shot because he was a famously awful free-throw shooter and concentrated on trying to get more of his points on the power slam.</p><p>Moreover, O’Neal signed a seven-year, $120 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers in 1996, which was the largest NBA contract ever. He contributed to the American Dream Team’s victory in the Olympic gold medal that same year in Atlanta, Georgia.</p><a href=#><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-243525 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shaquille-ONeal-WBUR.jpg alt="Joseph Toney" width=650 height=438 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p id=caption-attachment-243525 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Shaquille posing for a photo with a basketball<br>Source: WBUR</p><p>By the end of the decade, O’Neal was a member of the All-NBA First Team, the All-NBA Second Team twice (1995 and 1999), the All-NBA Third Team three times (1994, 1996, and 1997), and the All-NBA Third Team once (1995).
