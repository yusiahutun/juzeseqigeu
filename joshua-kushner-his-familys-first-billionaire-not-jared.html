In 2022, Thrive was reported to have US$16 billion in assets under management, according to TechCrunch. Thrive was an early investor in companies including Instagram (worth US$100 billion), Kickstarter (valued at up to US$50 billion) and ClassPass (US$1 billion).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Just two years after launch, Kushner had already raised US$40 million from investors, including Princeton University and venture capitalist Peter Thiel – known for investments in tech companies including Facebook and for supporting Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. But that year, a Thrive representative told Esquire that “Josh is a lifelong Democrat and will not be voting for Donald Trump in November”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Avoiding politics?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/06/f09160bc-e1e3-4c51-bcd8-27c73fbac822_eacb2dd4.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When it comes to politics, Kushner distances himself from his Republican family members … to an extent. He attended the Women’s March in Washington DC on the weekend of Trump’s inauguration but, as many protested against derogatory comments Trump had made about women, he shared a photograph of himself and his brother Jared at the White House that same weekend.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is no secret that liberal values have guided my life and that I have supported political leaders that share similar values,” Kushner told Forbes. “But neither political party has a monopoly on the truth or on constructive ideas for our country.

There is no connection, either good or bad’.” In 2022, Slack is valued at US$27.7 billion.</p>Thrive – which also invested in Robinhood and Spotify – was an early investor in <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Kim Kardashian’s Skims shapewear</span></a> and put US$240 million into a recent round.

Oscar Health relied on Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act’s health insurance model to operate, but when Trump slashed funding for Obamacare advertising, Kushner responded by stepping up ad campaigns in New York and collaborating with the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In March 2021, Oscar Health went public on the New York Stock Exchange at a valuation of US$7.3 billion but a year later that dropped to US$1.7 billion.

But the family still does business together and Kushner has a stake in the company. In 2014, Joshua and Jared also co-founded property crowdfunding start-up Cadre along with Ryan Williams, who is now the company’s CEO.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Down in the Trumps!
