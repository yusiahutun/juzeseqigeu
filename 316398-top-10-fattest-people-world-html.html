There are so many factors which may contribute to weight gain, and excessive eating is just one of them. Some people become fat, and it stops at a certain weight, others bear the burden of seeing their weight get out of control to double or even triple.</p><h2>Fattest people in the world</h2><p class=align-left>While it might be a bother to gain a kilo or two in a while to some of us, the struggle others go through is in an entirely different league. For this faction of people, they are looking at about hundreds of kilos. To them, their battle is no longer about shape. It is about life.

He, however, managed to undergo gastric surgery and the weight went down to around 560 pounds.</p><h3>2. Patrick Deuel</h3><p class=align-left>Think of someone being referred to as a 1000 pound man! Patrick Deuel could be the one. He weighed 1072 pounds and was commonly known as ‘Half-ton man’ among his peers, <a href=#>family</a> members, and the general public.
