She has competed in international competitions for the United States Equestrian Team. Jessica Springsteen, Bruce Springsteen’s daughter, has won multiple international equestrian competitions. She has also competed in the Show Jumping World Cup in the 2012 Summer Olympics representing&nbsp;the United States.</p><h4>Early Life</h4><p>Jessica is the only daughter and 2nd born child of Bruce Springsteen and Patti Scialfa, who are musicians. She was born in the United States on December 30, 1991, in Los Angeles. Jessica’s father is the head of the E Street Band and an American singer, guitarist, and songwriter. While Jessica’s mother, too, is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist who plays in her husband’s band, E-Street. She grew raised with Evan James Springsteen, her older brother, and Ryan Springsteen, her younger brother.</p><p>When Jessica and her brothers were old enough to go to school in the early 1990s, their parents moved them out of Los Angeles in order to raise a family away from the paparazzi. In Colts Neck Township, New Jersey, the family owned and operated a horse farm. They also had properties in Los Angeles, Florida, and New Jersey, including mansions in Wellington and Rumson. Jessica&nbsp;attended Rumson Country Day School in Rumson, New Jersey. On May 11, 2014, she graduated from Duke University with a bachelor’s degree.</p><h3>Jessica Springsteen Career</h3><p>Jessica&nbsp;has been riding horses since she was four years old on the Springsteen family’s 300-acre Stone Hill Farm in Colts Neck, New Jersey. When she was six years old, she got her first pony. She won competitions in the pony division as a child equitation rider, such as the Washington International Pony Equitation Classic Final, and then the 2008 ASPCA Maclay National Championship in a ride-off when her particularly daring riding stood out. In addition, she took home the George H. Morris Excellence in Equitation Championship in 2009.</p><p>In 2011, Jessica competed in the Royal Windsor Horse Show with her horse Vordnado Van Den Hoendrik as an adult competitor. Peter Charles, who won a gold medal for Great Britain in the equestrian sports at the 2012 Summer Olympics, sold his team’s gold medal-winning horse, Vindicat W, to Springsteen in September 2012. Springsteen competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics as an alternative rider for the United States. She won the American Gold Cup in 2014.</p><h4>Rise to Glory</h4><p>With her horse Cynar VA, she won her first five-star Grand Prix jumping competition in 2016, however she did not make the shortlist for the U.S. Equestrian Team for the 2016 Summer Olympics. In May 2017, she and Davendy S won the Falcon Stakes CSI 5* at the Royal Windsor Horse Show. Springsteen was selected to the United States equestrian squad in 2021, at the 2020 Summer Olympics that was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently she made into the US Olympic showjumping team which will compete in the Tokyo Summer Olympics 2020 later in this month.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Jessica Springsteen Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Jessica Rae Springsteen</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>December 30, 1991</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2021)</td><td>29 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Los Angeles, California, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Equestrian</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jessica-Springsteen-1.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 6” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 167 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 49 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 110 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Body Measurements</td><td>32-25-34</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Bra Size</td><td>32A</td></tr><tr><td>Waist Size</td><td>25 Inches</td></tr><tr><td>Hips Size</td><td>34 Inches</td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>8 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Athletic</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Bruce Springsteen</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Patti Scialfa</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>Two (Evan James & Samuel Ryan Springsteen)</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>Rumson Country Day School</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>Duke University</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jessica-Springsteen-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>In Relation</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Who is her Boyfriend?</td><td>Lorenzo De Luca</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Jessica is presently dating Lorenzo De Luca, a polo horse racer.
