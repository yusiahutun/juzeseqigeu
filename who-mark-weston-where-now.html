evidence.</p><p>The <a href=#>killer</a>, who murdered a young mother in 1995, was jailed in 2010 after a change to <a href=#>the double jeopardy law</a> allowed him to be tried for the <a href=#>crime</a> again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/COURTS_Vikki_121947jpg-JS344269.jpg><h2>Who is Mark Weston and what did he do to Vikki Thompson?</h2><p>Mark Weston was 35 when he was convicted of killing <a href=#>Vikki Thompson</a>, 15 years after her death.</p><p>Vikki, who was just 30 when she died, was killed on August 12, 1995, while walking her <a href=#>dog</a> Daisy in the village of Ascott-under-Wychwood, near&nbsp;<a href=#>Oxfordshire</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>England</a>.</p><p>Weston was masturbating down a country lane when Vikki walked past.</p><p>He then bludgeoned her over the head with a rock, dragged her body across a field and placed it on the railway line in an attempt to make it look like she had been hit by a train.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Crime">Read More on Crime</h2><p>When Vikki's dog made her way home on her own, Vikki's husband Jonathan and some of their neighbours, as well as their two young&nbsp;<a href=#>children</a>, Matthew and Jenny, began looking for her.</p><p>Vikki was found over three hours after she had left home, and was still alive.</p><p>She was taken to&nbsp;<a href=#>hospital</a>&nbsp;with severe skull fractures and a severe brain injury but, after six days, her brain stopped functioning and her life support machine was switched off.</p><p>Weston was arrested for Vikki's murder but denied being at the scene of the crime on that day or knowing the victim.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>He was acquitted in 1996 but, after police decided to reopen the investigation in 2008, they found specks of Vikki's blood on Weston's boots.</p><p>The shoes were re-examined by two scientists, using microscopes and halogen lamps that had not been available in 1995.</p><p>A damning text message Weston had sent to his ex-girlfriend was also discovered in the investigation.</p><p>The message read: "I killed her and I would do the same to you".</p><p>Another piece of evidence that was put before the jury at Weston's second trial was a plastic bag that police had found near the scene of Vikki's killing.</p><p>The bag contained two bras stained with semen matching Weston's <a href=#>DNA</a>.</p><p>The evidence was not allowed by the judge in the first trial.</p><p><a href=#>Police</a>&nbsp;were initially unable to re-try Weston due to&nbsp;the double jeopardy law, which prevents a person from being tried again for the same crime.</p><p>That law changed in 2005, leading to Weston's second trial.</p><p>Weston's conviction was the first time that new forensic evidence had been used to secure a conviction using double jeopardy legislation.</p><h2>Where is Mark Weston now?</h2><p>As of 2023, Weston is serving his <a href=#>prison</a> sentence for Vikki's murder.</p><p>On December 13, 2010, he was jailed for life with a minimum of 13 years.</p><p>Vikki's husband, Jonathan, said at the time that the change in the double jeopardy law had been "crucial in achieving justice".</p><p>After Weston's second trial it was revealed that he had allegedly tried to strangle the mother of his daughter in 2003.</p><p>Helen Rusher, who dated Weston when she was just 16, said that she reported him to the <a href=#>police</a>, and told them that Weston had confessed to killing Vikki.</p><p>Weston was convicted of harassing two other local women in the years between his two trials.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He was given a conditional discharge in 1997 after harassing a neighbour.</p><p>Then, in 1999, he received a two-year probation order for harassing a police officer and his wife and children, making 50 silent phone calls to their home.</p><p class=postsid
