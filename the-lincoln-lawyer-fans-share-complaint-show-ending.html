What a cliffhanger ending to part 1 of #TheLincolnLawyer season 2,” while another person added: “Not #TheLincolnLawyer leaving us on a cliffhanger! Didn't realize it wasn't the full season.” A third person added: “This cliffhanger,” with an unhappy face emoji.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: The Lincoln Lawyer season 2 part 2 trailer</figure><p id=e26m3gPAL8cl data-wc=55>While one person asked whether the show was enjoyable, another fan replied: “Yes, it’s really good. Just finished the first half of the second season. There is a frustrating cliffhanger there.” Another person added: “Pretty dope actually, at first I thought it was just one of those comedy-drama series, but it's pretty intense and interesting.”&nbsp;</p><p id=ew0Ihnaj12Ef data-wc=55>So what happened in the part one finale? In the episode, Mickey is alone in a parking lot while frustratedly searching for a vital missing document, when he is approached by two men who ask him if he is the famous lawyer.
