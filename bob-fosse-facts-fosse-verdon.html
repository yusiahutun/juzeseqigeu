From the first number in rehearsal, "Whatever Lola Wants," Verdon was hooked: "Watching Bob Fosse slithering and stalking his way through the oldest stripper tricks in the book," Wasson writes, "slipping off invisible gloves and shaking his imaginary tits, [Verdon] felt herself giving in.

The film co-starred actress Leland Palmer as Audrey Paris, the movie version of Verdon, while Fosse’s then-partner, Ann Reinking, played herself as Gideon's current girlfriend, Katie Jagger. It’s a deeply personal and honest self-portrait that won four Academy Awards, as well as Fosse's third Oscar nomination for Best Director.</p><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Fosse/Verdon: Season 1</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="Watch Now for Fosse/Verdon: Season 1" data-href=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PPQ4H3M/ data-product-url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PPQ4H3M/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PPQ4H3M/ data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","is_active":true,"details":null,"metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","is_active":true,"business_unit_id":"ad046b46-538b-42cb-aa54-c3d158875ed6","details":"","metadata":{},"created_at":"2021-07-28T16:03:03.241365+00:00","last_updated_at":"2021-07-28T16:03:03.241381+00:00"}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Watch Now" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PPQ4H3M/ data-vars-ga-product-id=219e8b62-40de-4257-ad96-88f2c1cc4f0b data-vars-ga-product-price=$19.99 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=073e65c5-030f-490c-b379-166b2567afb0 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=TV data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=B07PPQ4H3M data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Fosse/Verdon: Season 1" title="Fosse/Verdon: Season 1" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1554909299-41poxW9SmrL.jpg width=500 height=375 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Fosse/Verdon: Season 1</h2></p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>5) He suffered from epilepsy and mental health issues.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fosse was diagnosed with epilepsy in 1961 when he <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.masterworksbroadway.com/artist/bob-fosse/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="suffered a seizure" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">suffered a seizure</a> during rehearsals for a new show, The Conquering Hero. According to Wasson in Fosse, the choreographer also suffered from depression. "Fosse liked to joke about death and dying, but he was completely serious," Wasson wrote. Fosse regularly saw psychiatrist Dr. Clifford Sager, and took a mix of Benzedrine and Seconal to address his mood swings, keeping himself balanced between "up" and "down."</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>6) There’s a specific backstory behind Fosse’s signature style.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hallmarks of a typical Fosse number include black bowler hats, white gloves, and angular movements—dancers jutting out their limbs or hips, or isolating just one part of their body at a time, a style that Fosse pioneered. According to a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/22/theater/the-daring-of-fosse-s-indelible-signature.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="New York Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">New York Times</a> piece from 1996, Fosse said he favored hats because he started going bald at the age of 17. But the paper suggested “if that had been true, he would never have lifted the hats straight into the air with two hands; or tipped them jauntily, and elegantly, with two fingers, or tossed them off altogether. The reason he loved hats was that they helped call attention to the anatomical feature most important to his choreography, the head.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/8672d2dc-5b2b-4ad4-bbfb-fd434da819c6.jpg alt="Headshot of Emma Dibdin" title="Headshot of Emma Dibdin" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Emma Dibdin is a freelance writer based in Los Angeles who writes about culture, mental health, and true crime.
