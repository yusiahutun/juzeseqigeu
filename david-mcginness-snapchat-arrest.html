Per authorities, the pair spoke for a "short period of time," but the victim cut off communication with McGinness when she learned his age.</p><p>"A few months later. McGinness re-engaged the victim demanding nude photographs. When the victim refused to send the photographs McGinness began to make absolutely vile threats to rape and kill the victim and the victim's family members," said Ivey.</p><p>"McGinness went as far as to tell the victim he knew where they lived and would be there within an hour if the victim didn't comply," he continued, saying McGinness used the Snap Map feature -- which allows users to display where they are in real-time -- to learn her location. Per Ivey, the teen's location services were turned on, allowing McGinness to see where she was.</p><p>The teen reported his alleged behavior to her parents, who in turn alerted authorities.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3a4d9929-9455-4283-9758-e3e740a9b591 data-container-ref=toofab:article:746ab1a8-231a-4c14-986e-b32102fdbb8a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/61/5by4/2024/01/18/611269ebc70746c6a603a1c0666e8665_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Tulsa County Jail/KJRH</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Dad Accused of Fleeing Scene of Car Crash Involving Entire Family, Killing Teen Daughter</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Ivey said the suspect was arrested "even though he pinky promised he wasn't going to actually hurt anyone" and is being held on $76,000 bond.</p><p>The Sheriff concluded his post with a warning to parents, saying this case demonstrates why he always tells them "there is no better time than right now to talk with their children about internet and social media safety!"</p><p>"As parents, we want to allow our children to enjoy life but we also want to do everything possible to keep them safe, so if you allow your children to use social media or things connected to the internet, please routinely check all of the parental controls, privacy settings, and any other measures possible, to make sure that people like McGinness can't get to them!" he wrote.</p><p>"Always remember... monitoring everything they do is not an invasion of their privacy, it's just simply keeping them safe!"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f6caca68-4d93-4e9f-94cf-26b672577386 data-container-ref=toofab:article:746ab1a8-231a-4c14-986e-b32102fdbb8a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/cb/5by4/2024/01/13/cb4d1a86aa4344d9a03454b49df52881_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">5-Year-Old Alabama Boy Shot and Killed While Getting a Haircut</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pma2pfma63tcNmpJyfmaO7pr%2FSZqqnmaCYtaLAjJqpq52jqXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./edm-focused-arc-festival-returns-to-chicago-on-labor-day-weekend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>EDM-Focused Arc Festival Returns To Chicago On Labor Day Weekend</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fury-mcgregor-mbappe-bale-penis-31763386.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sports stars who looked like they had a 'third leg' from Tyson Fury to Kylian Mbappe</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
