I never, never wear pajamas in my life. I always feel I cannot sleep when I am dressed. I have to be naked. I am like Marilyn Monroe: She said five drops of Chanel No. 5; I tell you 10 drops of Roberto Cavalli fragrance. I'll tell you something else. A few times in my life when I went to the hospital for some reason, very silly, it was complicated for me, because they asked me to wear pajamas. When I wake up, my German shepherd, Lupo, jumps on the bed and starts to kiss me. He is a fantastic son. I also have a cat. She is tiny but she eats everything. Then I have my bird, a parrot, a big yellow-and-blue parrot, in the living room. Maybe she says hello to me. I go to her with a small cake and she eats it. I have many different pets: two dogs, the cat, parakeets, an iguana, a blackbird, and two aquariums full of fish. I especially love exotic fish. They have been an inspiration and are featured in my collections. I used to have a small tiger and a monkey but not anymore. The monkey was mean.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>9:15 A.M. </strong>The first thing I do is take a shower. I don't use many products. When I come down, I make some sketches. I prepare my breakfast and tea. Then I go to the computer and read all the magazines and the Herald Tribune.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>9:30 A.M.</strong> I don't go to work naked. I go to work all the time in my jeans. I have a minimum of 50 pairs of jeans—all Cavalli! I have three or four that are my favorites. One light black sweater. Cavalli panties, something zebra, leopard. Very tight. I put on Cavalli socks. I have 40 pairs of Cavalli cowboy boots—black, all the same. That's my personality. I have a very old Cavalli bag in denim and croco—dark blue. It is almost destroyed, but I love it and I can't change—it's part of me now. For big occasions, I have a beautiful gray silk shirt and one black tie. Today I am in Australia going to the Victoria Derby in Melbourne, where the guests will be Prince Charles and Camilla, and Nicole Kidman will be there, and, of course, Roberto Cavalli! I like to travel. I went to Papua New Guinea a couple of years ago and met one of the last cannibal tribes existing on the planet. Very exciting!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>10:00 A.M.</strong> I enjoy many forms of transportation. I love my boat. The hull's paint has a wonderful ever-changing color, obtained with special paint that I also used to paint my helicopter. The paint is iridescent, so when the sun is bright, the boat is a golden-purplish color, and when the sun goes down, it becomes navy blue. I used to ride a Segway around Florence in the summertime, but now I prefer to walk. I also have many big cars. I have a Ferrari, but in the last six months, I discovered the small electric car. I put Lupo in my car and drive to my office in Florence. I listen to music in the car. I love Duran Duran, Lenny Kravitz, the Rolling Stones, and so many others. They are all amazing artists but also personal friends, so listening to their music is very special to me. If not, I make phone calls. I have a very old Nokia Communicator telephone. Compared to the new ones, it is like a museum piece. I say good morning to all the people I love. In the future I will say hello to you!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Pictured above: Cavalli with his German shepherd, Lupo</p><img alt="this image is not available" title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>10:30 A.M.</strong> We go to my office, where I have to sign papers. An important man should do that every day. I have about 10 girls who work for me. They come to me to show me their work. I also create—it is big work because I have to create for Roberto Cavalli and for Just Cavalli. Everything that is design, everything that is part of my collections, comes from my heart, my mind, my stomach. Then I go one floor up to the style studios to speak with the designers. I start to mix the shapes with the prints and study them downstairs. It is part of my DNA. Honestly, I don't have appointments in my office in Florence. I don't want to speak with people because sometimes they interrupt my creation. Usually, when I have any appointments, I go to Milano, where I have another office.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>1:30 P.M.</strong> My lunch is a small lunch. I don't go to the gym, but I try to eat healthy and light. I like to sit with the people I love and have lunch. I like mozzarella, a healthy salad, so I don't feel too heavy in the afternoon.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>7:00 P.M.</strong> I finish work around seven. I stop in the center of Florence, near my store, where I have a very small bar, Caffè Giacosa. It's very cool, and many people go there for aperitifs between seven and eight o'clock.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>9:00 P.M.</strong> I don't like to go out at night that much. I have to attend many events for my work, so when I can, I enjoy spending time at home. The only two places where I really like to go when I am off duty are my two restaurant-clubs in Milano and Dubai. I drink only red wine, mostly Cavalli Tenuta degli Dei. If I dine at home, I prefer to cook. I do a very good branzino al sale. But most of my time is spent designing, looking through my camera. I have so many cameras. I have almost every kind that exists; sometimes they are given to me before they are in stores. I am crazy about photos. I have many crystal balls in my house. My wife loves to collect them, and I also love them because they are mysterious, which is why I decided to create some for my home collection. And I like all the women. Femininity is my biggest source of inspiration.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>12:00 A.M.</strong> I go to sleep very late. It's very late because I have my Roberto Cavalli blog. I spend every night writing on it. Then I go on Twitter. I have two Twitters. One is for Roberto Cavalli, the designer—I speak and give advice to my fans. The other is Roberto Cavalli on politics: Uniti per un sogno, "Together for a dream." It is in Italian because the situation in Italy is catastrophic. On Twitter I write what I think, what I feel. I make a lot of tweets, maybe 20 to 35.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>1:30 A.M.</strong> My bedroom, it is very beautiful, very modern. There is a big window by my bed. On the right I have portraits that were painted by my grandfather. That is my bedroom. When I go to bed, oh, my God, it is very private. It is very private because there are a lot of fantasies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfm660tMiopWiclai2qLrEq6pomWlogHB%2Bk2afqK2iqHq4tdOhZKunkpq%2FtbuMnJivmZyhtm58kWpqaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./43-facts-about-jennifer-beals.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>43 Facts about Jennifer Beals</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jamal-harrison-bryant.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Jamal Harrison Bryant dating?
