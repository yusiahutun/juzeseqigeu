their gay wedding</p><p>But the star, who was not openly gay during his time in children’s TV for fear it would ruin his career, called the ceremony his ‘coming out’ party.</p><p>Kathryn Apanowicz, partner of the late Countdown host Richard Whiteley, read a poem during the service this month at Marble Hill mansion in Twickenham, South-West London.</p><p>Calling it a ‘joyous day’, Mark, who was known for being accident-prone on Blue Peter, said: ‘I’m a bit of a worrier. I get nervous just putting on a dinner party, so I was more than a little jittery about how things would go. Thankfully, there were no accidents or dramas.’</p><p>Mark, 47,who hosted Blue Peter from 1986 to 1989, added: ‘Jeremy and I are both mature people, who care deeply for each other and decided to formalise our union simply for legal purposes.<br></p><p>'Our families are 100 per cent supportive. It’s not that we needed to make any kind of declaration of our love.’</p><a rel href=# class=lightboxPopupLink onclick=return!1><span class=clickToEnlargeTop>Enlarge</span> <span class=clickToEnlarge></span> <span class=clickToEnlargeButton>&nbsp;</span> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/09/20/article-0-02B9F70700000578-901_468x592.jpg height=592 width=468 alt="In his TV heyday: Blue Peter presenter Mark Curry with Caron Keating and Yvette Fielding" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p class=imageCaption>In his TV heyday: Blue Peter presenter Mark Curry with Caron Keating and Yvette Fielding</p><p>Jeremy, 52, was previously married for 16 years and has two daughters – Emma, 27, and Kate, 21.<br></p><p>Kate and her mother Susan were both at the wedding. ‘It was a very happy occasion, shared with family and friends. We are both delighted,’ said Jeremy.</p><p>The reception at Caffe La Fiamma, near Hampton Court Palace, included music from former Mud bass player Ray Stiles and Ian Parker from newly reformed Sixties group The Hollies.</p><p>The cafe manager, known as Jari, said: ‘It was a happy and boisterous affair. Mark was in good spirits and told a lot of jokes. Everyone seemed to have had a very good time.’</p><p>Mark, who now runs a dating agency, said: ‘I’ve known that I was gay since my late teens, but I was advised early in the Eighties, by a seasoned ex-presenter, that it was best to keep quiet.</p><p>‘I never told a lie, or took girls out to parties to throw people off. I was always true to myself and people who mattered knew. Still, there was always a worry I might lose my job if the public found out. But thankfully, times have changed and today no one is penalised for being who they are.’</p><p>He met Jeremy on a blind date and said: ‘It was not exactly love at first sight. But it was pretty close. He’s a great bloke and my best friend. He’s brought incredible joy into my life.’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmhpbWhtfXh7pLFke6SlmnqRsdOeqWarpJa%2FbpnAq6Jme6Wnv7p5zJqpq6GVqHqordhmp5qqpKOys3nYnpirq16dwa64</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./michelle-yeoh-cheetah-print-trench-coat.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Michelle Yeoh Shows Her Sartorial Claws in a Cheetah-Print Trench Coat</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./does-flour-expire.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Does Flour Expire?
