Later, it looked like the singer <a href=#>subtly acknowledged the kiss</a> with her sweet caption on Instagram.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>Now, body language experts are analyzing the viral moment of the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> and what the declaration of ‘love’ means for the music icon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1788432708-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-s-teenage-crush-is-clear-to-see>Taylor Swift’s ‘teenage crush’ is clear to see</h2><p>Tay Tay is not shying away from telling the world that she might just have a really big crush on <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a>. The singer’s <a href=#>passionate kiss</a> with the 34-year-old NFL <a href=#>celebrity</a> has made Swifties swoon and experts claim that the duo had different ways of reciprocating their love in public. While Taylor is open and candid, Travis seems more reserved.</p><p>“This has to be an open declaration of love from Taylor as she walks from the stage with one last wave to her army of Swifties before skipping and running straight into Kelce’s arms,” body language expert Judi James <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. “Given that Taylor had just delighted the fans with a sell-out and world-beating show it was very much her running to him while he stuck with his arms down at his sides rather than held out towards her.”</p><p>Taylor’s enthusiastic hug and ‘over-arching impression’ also prove her crush on Travis, according to Judi, who added that the latter’s smile is a signal that he, too, is smitten.</p><p>In the end, “It was Taylor clinging romantically in a PDA while he then walked her inside,” that allegedly showed he is more reserved.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-is-fangirling-over-travis>Taylor is fangirling over Travis</h2><p>Taylor Swift has established herself as the <a href=#>pop culture icon of the era</a> when so many faded but she is still here, but the singer never lets her pride take the front seat when in love. Judi talks about how Taylor is openly fangirling over Travis.</p><p>“Taylor looks openly besotted here, throwing her arms around Kelce’s neck as though rewarding and congratulating him, rather than the other way around,” she said.</p><p>“She seems to be signalling that however big a star she is, she’s a fan of Kelce’s, just like her dad Scott, who was sporting Kelce’s lanyard.”</p><p>Judi also believes that Travis could have been more open in his PDA offering. “It surely should have been him running to her as she came off stage. She deserves the homage to her status and talent and she has been paying him status compliments by attending his games dressed in the kit while cheering and yelling in total support.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2d9cMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02aqop%2BelrmqusZmm56bnJa%2FosDIqKVmp5ZiubDCxGaZrqxdqb%2BiwsisZKKrXZawtbXNoGSrnaOav7exw2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tori-spelling-reveals-moment-she-knew-marriage-dean-mcdermott-was-over.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tori Spelling reveals the moment she knew her marriage to Dean McDermott was over</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./scenic-train-rides-in-america.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Romantic Train Rides - Most Scenic Train Rides In America</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
