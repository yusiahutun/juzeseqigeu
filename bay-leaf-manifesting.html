"There are so many flowers and plants that can bring positive energy to your home aside from bay leaves, as different blooms are known for improving mood, energy and memory - all things which can help contribute to achieving your goals,"&nbsp;explains <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Interflora</a>’s Brand Manager Bethany Day, "Looking at search trends across the past five years, we can see spikes in search interest for ‘manifestation’ in the December - January period, suggesting that lots of people are using this time to manifest the things they want in the upcoming year."</p><p id=eipYXRDmN4CJ data-wc=114>“Long-term benefits of manifesting include having more control over the bits of your life you can control. It also allows you to trust and lean into the hard parts. It can improve your mental health, your relationships, and your self-worth. As well as giving you a sense of calm,” explains manifestation expert <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Jennifer Sanchez</a>, "The biggest benefit of manifesting is becoming consciously aware of handed-down behavioural patterns, stories, and ways of living. Being able to examine these patterns and decide if they are working towards the life you want allows you to realise the outcomes that you want to see."&nbsp;Luckily for us Jennifer provides a step-by-step guide on how to perform bay leaf manifestation.</p><p id=eYwRkVMma9Xx data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>35 Beauty Trends that are going to be everywhere in 2023</a></strong></p><p id=eqv0l2jEUY48 data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>A Claridge's spa has just arrived in London and this is what you need to know</a></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/203453b5b058-bayleaf-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p id=ero2I6mY0YzW data-wc=8><strong>Bay leaves have exploded in popularity on TikTok</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>How to perform a Bay Leaf Manifestation:</strong>.&nbsp;</h2><p id=eDdNkmWJcCn6 data-wc=32>“Firstly make sure any fires you start are done with a fireproof dish and you don’t have any allergies to bay leaves”. (*Please make sure all fires are handled with utmost care.)</p><p id=e0Zw2Cco_sS8 data-wc=48>“Get clear on the thing you do want, you may want to journal to get the desired outcome clear in your mind, or you could use a vision board, or meditation with visualisation. Do whichever is easiest and feels best for you to dream as big as possible.”&nbsp;</p><p id=ek210vWg-I7k data-wc=50>“If you find you are focusing on what you don’t want you may need to do a clearing letter to make space for your manifestation. A clearing letter can look like an angry letter to an ex, mum, dad, or something you are carrying that is taking up heart space.”&nbsp;</p><p id=eMzrlFtP3i1n data-wc=63>“Once you have written the letter, burn it and watch the burden float away, now you have space for your manifesting. From your vision board, journal, or meditation, write some clear points, either one word or a mantra using a sharpie directly onto a dried bay leaf. Write in the present tense, for example ‘I am rich’ not ‘I want to be rich’.”&nbsp;</p><p id=eNlaYVa8i79g data-wc=26>“Hold onto the bay leaf, close your eyes and imagine yourself at the desired point. Give yourself at least 2 minutes to visualise the end goal.”&nbsp;</p><p id=ezn20vud5vAn data-wc=43>“Remember, focus equals feel, so once your whole body is focused on that final belief it will start to feel good. Once that good feeling is spread, burn the bay leaf using tongs, a dried bay leaf will be much easier to burn.”&nbsp;</p><p id=eir2BOoTOQRf data-wc=36>“Pop the bay leaf on a fireproof dish and while it burns get excited about your manifestation, and say, “thank you universe, God, spirit, or Allah”, whatever feels right, and celebrate as if it has happened.”&nbsp;</p><p id=emgYOOk9tBeg data-wc=40>“Gratitude is a huge part of manifesting but acting out receiving the manifestation also means we create the neural pathways needed to receive the manifestation (as often when what we ask for turns up, we self-sabotage and push it away).”&nbsp;</p><p id=eaFZIcLE4ax1 data-wc=35>“Now you need to return your ashes to the earth. Do this in whichever way feels best for you, either plant them, throw them to the wind, or release them into a body of water.”&nbsp;</p><p id=e19dYcG_mRld data-wc=27>“Trust that they are getting to work for you.
