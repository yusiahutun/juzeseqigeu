Plan dates, suggest outings, and take control of the direction you want the relationship to go. This displays your assertiveness and signals to him that you are a strong and capable individual. By asserting yourself in this way, you make him realize that you have a clear vision and are not afraid to take charge. It can spark his admiration and make him appreciate your assertive nature, potentially leading him to value your presence in his life even more.</p><h2><strong>27.</strong> &nbsp; <strong>Roll the Dice of Jealousy</strong></h2><p>When spending time with your friends, make sure to share every moment spend on social media. Dress well, write fun-loving captions, and even tell the stories to him. Share your moments with him and tell him how you love capturing memories with your friends.

Show him that you are capable of handling things on your own and that you don't need his help for every little task. By refusing his help, you make him realize that he may not be as essential in your life as he thought.
