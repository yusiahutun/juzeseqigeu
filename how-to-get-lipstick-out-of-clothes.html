And if you’ve ever tried to wash out lipstick stains, you know they can be particularly stubborn. But before you send that shirt to the trash bin, we asked experts how to get lipstick stains out of clothes, and here are their best stain-lifting tricks.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why is lipstick so difficult to remove?</h2><p>The answer lies in its composition, says Melissa Caverly, laundry expert and founder of <a href=# rel=noopener>Imagine Maids</a>. “Lipstick is oil-based and contains both waxes and pigments — this combination allows it to moisturize and adhere to your skin to give you that beautiful lip color,” Caverly explains. “But it also means it sticks to fabric fibers with the same stubbornness.”</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3 easy steps to get lipstick out of clothes</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Step 1: Remove excess</h3><p>To start, you’ll want to make sure any excess lipstick is removed, but don’t rub the stain, as this can help further set it in. Instead, simply grab a plastic knife or credit card and use it to gently scrape off any excess pigment. You can also use a sticky piece of tape to dab off residue.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Step 2: Pretreat the stains</h3><p>Pinpoint the right pretreatment to ensure the best results once you place the stained garment in the wash. Luckily, you have lots of options to choose from. Just consider one of the easy methods below.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>The best overall pretreament: Enzyme-based laundry detergent</h4><p>The same soap you use to clean your clothes can also act as a stain pretreatment in its pure form, explains <a href=# rel=noopener>Nathaly Vieira</a>, owner of <a href=# rel=noopener>InspireClean</a>. , adding that this method should also be gentle enough for most fabrics. “This is especially true with enzyme-based detergent, because the enzymes are designed to break down and dissolve oils. They are very powerful when not diluted by the water in your wash cycle. Just pour enough to cover the stain and let sit for 15 minutes.”</p><p>Two options: Ecos Plus with Stain-Fighting Enzymes Laundry Detergent (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Walmart, $27.55</a>) and Bio Enzyme Laundry Detergent (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Dirty Labs, $14</a>).</p><p>But if you don’t have these detergents on hand, the following household staples can work as well:</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>For delicate fabric: Dish soap</h4><p>Grease-fighting dish soaps like Dawn or Palmolive help break down the oils that cause oil-based lipstick pigments to stick to fabrics, explains Angel Rubin from <a href=# rel=noopener>Hellamaid</a>. “Just squirt enough soap to cover the stain and let it sit for about 15 minutes.” Dish soap is one of the most versatile options for removing lipstick stains because it is gentle enough to use on even delicate fabrics like silk and linen.</p><p>Also ideal for delicates? White vinegar. It helps dissolve oils, and although it’s not as powerful as other stain removers, it won’t be harsh on fabric, adds Vieira. “For this pretreatment, simply mix two parts white vinegar with one part water, then pour over the stain and let sit for 15 minutes.”</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>For cottons and wools: Rubbing alcohol</h4><p>Look no further than rubbing alcohol, which may be too harsh for delicate fabrics but will work well on your sweaters, t-shirts and hoodies. It’s a solvent, which means it liquefies oil so surfactants — i.e., laundry detergent — can easily absorb and remove it.</p><p>“Rubbing alcohol may be too harsh on upholstery made of silk or wool, so always spot test it before using. Then apply it the same way you would dish soap: just pour a bit over the stain and let sit for 15 minutes,” says Rubin, who adds that alcohol-based hairspray or even vodka can work in a pinch, too.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>For whites: Ammonia</h4><p>Like rubbing alcohol, ammonia is a solvent but a strong alkaline type that helps break down oils. It can also have a bleaching effect, which makes it great for whites, but be cautious using it on bright colors. “Simply mix equal parts ammonia and water in a bowl, then use an old toothbrush to gently apply it to the stain,” says Vieira.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Step 3: Put stained items in the laundry</h3><p>After you’ve successfully pretreated your lipstick stain, you can basically launder your clothes as usual. Just use the hottest water setting the fabric will allow, since heat helps liquify any oils and wax left in the stain, so your laundry detergent will ensure all traces are removed.</p><p>After the wash cycle is complete, check to make sure the stain is completely gone before putting the garment in the dryer. That’s because once heated and dried, any remnants of the stain can set and be even more challenging to remove. If there’s any hint of lipstick remaining, simply repeat the cycle starting with your stain-removing pretreatment again.&nbsp;</p><p>Related: <a href=#>Expert Cleaners Reveal How To Get Coffee Stains Out of Any Surface (Really!)</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What if I placed my still-stained items in the dryer?</h2><p>In this case, you’ll want to apply either a commercial stain treatment product such as Shout Laundry Stain Treatment (<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Buy from W.B. Mason, $8.49</a>) or Seventh Generation Laundry Stain Remover (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from FreshDirect, $5.59</a>). Or try oxygen-based (aka non-chlorine) bleach, which, unlike chlorine bleach, is safe to use on colors and prints.</p><p>If you’re using a commercial stain treatment, follow the directions on the bottle for how long to apply to a set-in stain.</p><p>If you’re using bleach, dilute it according to the product’s directions, then pour it into a bin and submerge the entire garment and allow it to soak at least eight hours or overnight. Then, regardless of which method you used, try laundering it in hot water again.</p><p>Related: <a href=# rel=noopener>Experts Reveal Just How Long Can Clothes Sit Wet in the Washer Before Getting Moldy</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>To avoid getting lipstick on clothes in the first place</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/shutterstock_1755409043.jpg><p>Even easier than getting a lipstick stain out of clothes is not having to deal with one in the first place.
