After a busy year of touring, filming the movie The Hammer (a Lifetime project set to air in January), and starring in the ABC hit series Big Sky alongside her boyfriend, Rex Linn, she was relieved to take some time off to relax and make new holiday traditions with her family and friends this year. “We’re living in Albuquerque right now, where we did a traditional Mexican Thanksgiving — it was so fun that we plan to carry it on into our Christmas festivities,” Reba shared with FIRST earlier this month. “We also used to go to our local post office, ask them for any letters that were sent to Santa, and fulfill those wishes. We hope to start doing that again this year — it is just so rewarding!”</p><p>Reba shared some additional holiday bliss through her new album, Reba: The Ultimate Christmas Collection. And she has plenty more ideas for spreading cheer well into the new year. Keep reading to learn Reba’s tips for a healthy, happy life.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Help others to spark your own joy.</h2><p>“I’m looking forward to helping poor old Santa Claus out because I know he’s busy,” Reba told FIRST before the holidays — but her advice about giving back can be extended into the new year, too. “If there’s an electric bill I can pay or if I can step in where a family needs help, that’s what I’ll do. It brings me so much joy!” she shared. Bonus: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Giving back</a> can help lower stress, anger, and anxiety. As Reba pointed out, the social contact aspect of helping others can definitely boost your own emotional well-being.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Get luxe lashes for pennies.</h2><p>“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">L’Oréal Voluminous Mascara</a> ($10) is my must-have drugstore favorite,” Reba shared of the affordable makeup product that helps emphasize her famous blue eyes. “I’ve used it since I was in the Broadway show Annie Get Your Gun in 2001, after one of the dancers told me about it. It makes my lashes so long — I love it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Keep it moving to keep arthritis at bay.</h2><p>“I like to go on walks with my friends and family, and Rex and I take our French bulldog, Riddler, out for a walk to keep us motivated,” she said. “At our age, we’ve got to keep moving. Mama always said, ‘If you don’t use it, you lose it.’ And that’s with your voice, that’s with your muscles. <a href=#>Arthritis is a big thing</a> in my age group, so I keep moving. It’s important.” She’s right: Joint-friendly and low-impact exercise, such as walking, can <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">help ease the pain</a> and stiffness of arthritis sufferers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Eat healthy to energize and invigorate.</h2><p>“Ginger is good for everything!” Reba said of her go-to picker-upper. “We do a lot of smoothies with ginger, protein powder, vitamins, carrots, and beets. The benefit is quick: You don’t have to wait for a pill that’s in your stomach to dissolve. Smoothies absorb quickly and leave me feeling great.” Indeed, both <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">juicing and blending smoothies</a> can provide health benefits, since this method may help a person fit in more servings of healthy fruits and veggies every day; plus, fruit and vegetables can help fight against heart disease by lowering your blood pressure and bad cholesterol. To Reba’s point, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ginger makes a great smoothie addition</a> because it’s low in calories and rich in vitamins and minerals, providing you with fiber, phosphorus, calcium, iron, potassium, and zinc.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ease stress by planning early.</h2><p>To keep holiday stress at bay, Reba sticks to one rule: “Shop early!” Although Christmas is now over, you can keep these tips in mind for next year. “I’ve been looking through websites and finding unusual gifts,” she told FIRST earlier in December. “I’m a big game player, and on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rod’s True Western website</a> — they have clothes, decor, and all kinds of stuff — I found some really fun games for my family and friends. We’re all into horses and we’re all cattling, and there are some great horse-themed things to choose from on that site. Early shopping online is the way I love to do it, and it’s more fun too. You’ve just got to remember where you put it!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Don’t miss Reba’s new clothing line.</h2><p>There’s no doubt that Reba has had a year of wonder. She opened <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reba’s Place</a> (a restaurant, live music venue, and retail store in Atoka, Oklahoma), and another of her proudest 2022 accomplishments is her new line of clothing, appropriately called “Reba,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sold exclusively at Dillard’s</a>. “There’s a lot of long sweaters and dresses in a great color palette and we’ve got bling in everything,” she beamed. “We’ve kept it fancy but comfortable — we’ve even got velour pants with elastic waists and big, comfortable, cozy sweaters that have sequins. When you’re eating a lot around Christmas, you got room to grow — it’s a beautiful lineup!”</p><p>Reba also has a new line with Justin Boots. “We’re looking forward to the new boots because they’re going to be super sparkly,” she said. Can you sense a pattern here? Clearly, Reba likes her sparkle and shine. So, go grab yourself some Reba gear, follow her tips, and you’ll be heading into the new year with style and pizzazz.</p><p>This content is not a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.
