The young royal was given the meadow as a christening gift from Count Tibor Kalnoky, who is close friends with the monarch. At the time, Count Tibor explained: "If we sent flowers they would wilt, so this is a symbolic gift. Wild flowers are fragile like newborn babies. This gift will protect this area and contribute to raising public awareness so that rare flowers can be protected."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: King Charles visits the Chelsea Flower Show</figure><p id=eEA5d5K-zd data-wc=48>Although George was given the gift back in 2013, the royal has not yet been able to visit the European nation and see the beautiful wildflowers himself. However, with the young royal about to go on half-term, perhaps his parents will take him out during his week off?</p><p id=eU2F9f0Acq data-wc=52>The meadow wasn't George's only <a class=hm-link href=#>touching gift from his christening</a>, as his aunt, <a class=hm-link href=#>Pippa Middleton</a>, is believed to have visited Wrightson and Platt, a company who make silver casts of a baby's hands and feet which are then engraved with their name and date of birth for a bespoke gift for George.</p><p id=et67pJjeG1 data-wc=46>Charles typically spends a couple of days a year in Romania and the <a class=hm-link href=#>guest house</a> is then rented out to the public. It's known as the Blue House, and features seven double bedrooms with en-suites, a drawing and dining room, a sitting room and a kitchen.</p><p id=eer9piPcQ7 data-wc=57>The property takes its name from the distinct blue hue of the building. A rustic aesthetic is maintained throughout, with high ceilings and concrete white walls. The bedrooms are furnished exclusively with antique Transylvanian furniture and according to the guesthouse's website, there are no televisions or radios, in order to create an atmosphere "of peace and tranquility".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e8cdedc724db-king-charles-romania.jpg><p id=eLNloONHgj data-wc=39>Three of the bedrooms' en-suites feature their own bathtubs and the space is decorated with patterned wallpaper and hand-painted plates, reflecting authentic Transylvanian culture. The guest house has its own outdoor breakfast barn, complete with an enormous bread oven.</p><p id=eVDuQDmigo data-wc=57>It will be the King's first visit to the country since the passing of his mother back in September. Last year, the royal was photographed hiking in the Romanian wilderness near the estate. Charles was dressed down for his walk sporting stone-coloured trousers, a shirt rolled up at the sleeves and a pair of sensible hiking boots.</p><p id=eacang0LIZ data-wc=14><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>See King Charles and Queen Camilla's coronation crowns up close in new exhibition</a></p><p id=eljW0_sdKR data-wc=47>While her husband is away, Queen Camilla will remain at <a class=hm-link href=#>her Ray Mill residence in Wiltshire</a>, which is a spectacular property that boasts stables, an outdoor swimming pool and even its own river, bought by the Queen for £850,000 in 1994, following her divorce from Andrew Parker-Bowles.</p><p id=eg2IPO6GSF data-wc=51>Before Charles and Camilla were crowned, the King boasted an incredible £1.2billion property portfolio but ahead of the monarch's coronation day, Charles passed his Duchy of Cornwall holdings onto Prince William. However, he still owns several private homes, from Clarence House in London to Dolphin House on the Isles of Scilly.</p><p id=e-h5nExMmj data-wc=31><strong>Make sure you never miss a royal story!<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to The Royal Explainer newsletter</a> to receive your weekly dose of royal features and other exclusive content straight to your inbox.</strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
