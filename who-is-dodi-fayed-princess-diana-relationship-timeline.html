As the son of billionaire Mohammed Al Fayed, who formerly owned Harrods department store and The Ritz Paris, Dodi is desperate to eke out his own success, particularly setting his sights on the film industry. Meanwhile, Season 5 also showed the long and messy road to divorce between Princess Diana (Elizabeth Debicki) and Prince Charles (Dominic West). Eventually, their paths convergeâ€”and you'll have to tune into Season 6 to see their full story.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In real life, Diana and Dodi started dating after she took Prince William and Prince Harry to St. Tropez to vacation with his family. Later, model Kelly Fisher would claim that she and Dodi were still engaged at the time the tabloids started reporting on his romance with Diana.
