I left Octomom. I went back to my life as a counselor, I went back to make sure my kids had a happy, healthy life," she explains to the show's hosts. "I knew it was directly hurting my family. I had to protect them, I'm very very protective."</p><p>"When [people] do come up and say, 'Hi, can I take a picture with you?' and 'Hi, are you Octomom?' I say, 'I no longer go by that anymore, but thank you so much,'" she adds. "I'm a mom and I don't do that anymore."</p><p>"I'm still in the process of pulling my self worth out of the toilet, I flushed it down multiple times," she says of her past, which also included time as a stripper. "Like all human beings, we make mistakes and we learn, we grow, we change."</p><p>She went on to explain how the "cycle of exploitation" she put herself through caused her to self-medicate with drugs. These days, she says she's clean.</p><p>"When I was violating my own core values and boundaries, there's going to be some kind of repercussions. I had to emotionally numb with a mood altering substance in order to continue that," she reveals. "It was poisonous, horrible, detrimental to me. I walked away from what was causing me to use it. I was repeating violating my own self, I was living a life incongruent to what I believed in, my value system."</p><p>Suleman, 41, adds that she takes accountability for "being dumb and irresponsible and selfish" with her desire to have so many children at once. She says she has no desire to "burden" tax payers by being on welfare and adds she is working hard to support her 14 children.</p><p>Yes, she has six other children in addition to the octuplets.</p><p>"I own and take responsibility for my poor choices, but it doesn't take away from how extraordinary these kids turned out to be," she says.</p><p>The kids then came out to prove how well-adjusted they are, as <strong>Noah</strong>, <strong>Maliyah</strong>, <strong>Isaiah</strong>, <strong>Nariyah</strong>, <strong>Jonah</strong>, <strong>Makai</strong>, <strong>Josiah</strong> and <strong>Jeremiah</strong> all stepped out on stage to greet the hosts.</p><p>When asked what they think of their mama, one of Natalie's children replies, "She does a great job."</p><p>Check out the video below to see the children get an early surprise for their eighth birthday, which actually happens in January.</p><p>To see more from Suleman, <strong><a href=#>check local listings</a></strong> to see when "The Doctors" airs in your neck of the woods!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnd7kGpmaWlfpLC1u8yopGasmJp6pbvCraarq12ksLXBz6Wcratdo7y4ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./phoebe-philo-old-celine-resale.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Phoebe Philo era Celine is more popular than ever on resale</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./428886-nascar-pit-crew-salaries-2021-how-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nascar pit crew salaries in 2021: How much do they make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
