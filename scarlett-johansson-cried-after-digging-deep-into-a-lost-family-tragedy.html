Her grandfather had moved to New York and become a grocer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-scarlett-johansson-upset-by-family-tragedy>Scarlett Johansson upset by family tragedy</h2><p>Reading about her great-uncle’s circumstances, the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actress finds out that he lived in “a 1.3-square mile area sealed off from the rest of the city” where Jewish people were forced to live.</p><p>“Losing each other and everything. I mean, you hear stories about men and women and children all being separated and that was it,” said Scarlett,</p><p>“You know, [you would] never see the other person again. I can not imagine what you must be feeling just…hell. It must’ve been hell.”</p><p>According to the show, where her great-uncle lived “more than 400,000 Jews were crammed into the ghetto, living in squalid conditions with insufficient food rations. No more than 20,000 of them survived the Holocaust.”</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>Jodie Foster’s unknown link to the assassination attempt on the president</a></strong></p><p>Reading her family’s document, Scarlett Johansson says: “Wow, that’s sad” before becoming emotional.</p><p>“I mean, you really couldn’t imagine the horror. It’s just so crazy to imagine. … It’s crazy to imagine that Saul would be on the other side selling bananas on Ludlow Street,” the Hollywood star says.</p><p>“And how different it would be being in America at that time. The fate of one brother versus the other.”</p><p>Although she said she “didn’t expect to” she “felt more deeply connected” to that side of her family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1138769227-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bill-murray-was-hard-to-work-with>Bill Murray was “hard” to work with</h2><p>The 39-year-old has also opened up about working with Bill Murray on the 2003 <a href=#>movie</a> Lost in Translation and said that the experience was “hard” as it was long days and he “has a lot of energy.” However, she said that she was “so excited’ to work with him.</p><p>“It was such a strange space that we were in… we made that film in something crazy like 27 days. It was a hard shoot for me. I felt sort of out of the loop. I was 17 years old when I made that movie,” she said (per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Far Out</a>).</p><p>“He’s a comedian. He’s quirky. He had a lot of ups and downs. He had a lot of energy. He was really always&nbsp;on. And I was a 17-year-old, and I was more introspective.”</p><p>She said during the interview with DJ Howard Stern that she felt “intimidated” by his presence and found it “hard to relate to” the now 73-year-old.</p><p>“Yeah, it was hard for me. That’s what was kinda isolating about it – everybody was so deferential.” However the two celebrities “worked really well together.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-return-to-the-mcu>A return to the MCU?</h2><p>After her incarnation of Black Widow died while sacrificing herself in Avengers Endgame, the actress was recently asked on the Today show if there was any chance of a return. She remained fairly tight-lipped on the matter saying: “Like a loophole? I feel like that’s kind of the end, right? Like can you come back? Could it be a vampire version of the character? Cause I’m here for that, like a zombie version, maybe.”</p><p>After being questioned further about the possibility, she replied: “You really ask the hard questions. I feel like I have to tell you, but I actually don’t have to tell you, Al. I do not, but I want to so bad” before trying to steer the conversation elsewhere.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong><a href=#> Owen Wilson has never met his lookalike daughter after DNA test result</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2eBcL%2FCmqmlnaSpequ7x5qlrKufo3qkvsiem2aZlqmys3nDop6goZ6ceqWxxKlkoqakpHqiecuoqq1llpa6qrjYZqurmZeasbp7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./toni-braxton-short-hair-i-heart-you-photo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Toni Braxton Sports Short Hair in New Music Video!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shahs-of-sunset-bravocon.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Reza, GG and MJ from Shahs of Sunset Give Updates on New Projects Post-Show Cancelation</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
