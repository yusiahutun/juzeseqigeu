While most of us are familiar with names such as Fitbit and Garmin, there’s a new contender on the market. One which promises to help you "unlock yourself" and is branded as the most advanced fitness and health wearable available.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>We are, of course, talking about WHOOP. The company released the WHOOP 4.0 watch in September 2021, but is it worth buying?</p><h2 id=what-is-whoop>What Is WHOOP?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WHOOP-Health-Monitor_Lifestyle.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WHOOP</a> is a brand on a mission to unlock human performance. Over the past decade, the company has worked tirelessly with a team of engineers, designers, data scientists, and professionals to produce a wearable tracker designed to give you the highest standard of fitness and health feedback.</p><p>This has culminated in the creation of the WHOOP 4.0, which is currently ahead of the market as the most advanced fitness and health wearable around.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=what-is-the-whoop-4-0>What Is the WHOOP 4.0?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WHOOP-40_Strain_Wrist.jpg><p>The WHOOP 4.0 isn’t a Fitbit, and it isn’t a smartwatch either. It’s a health and fitness wearable that monitors your sleep, recovery, and daily effort 24/7 and then transmits this data to the WHOOP app, where it is analyzed. It doesn’t have a screen, there are no notifications, and its minimal, classy design has been engineered to feel weightless while looking chic and discreet.</p><p>The more you wear the WHOOP 4.0, the more it learns about your body, and the more accurately the WHOOP app can coach you to help you reach your full performance potential. It’ll teach you <a href=#>how to manage your heart rate zones</a>, coach you to a better night's sleep, and can even let you know when you might be falling in before you have any symptoms.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=how-does-the-whoop-4-0-differ-from-the-whoop-3-0>How Does the WHOOP 4.0 Differ From the WHOOP 3.0?</h2><p>The WHOOP 3.0 was good, but the WHOOP 4.0 is even better. Here are some of the key differences between WHOOP 3.0 and WHOOP 4.0.</p><h3 id=whoop-4-0-is-smaller>1. WHOOP 4.0 Is Smaller</h3><p>The new WHOOP 4.0 is 33% smaller than its predecessor, taking up less space on the wrist and making it less likely to snag or get in the way while going about your daily life. It also comes with a new SuperKnit band designed to be worn on the wrist or removed and worn in WHOOP body apparel.</p><h3 id=whoop-4-0-has-more-sensors>2. WHOOP 4.0 Has More Sensors</h3><p>Despite being 33% smaller than the WHOOP 3.0, the WHOOP 4.0 has an even better sensor configuration, including five LEDs and four photodiodes to capture your data continuously.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=the-whoop-4-0-vibrates>3. The WHOOP 4.0 Vibrates</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WHOOP-40_Sleep.jpg><p>The WHOOP 4.0 has also been designed to take sleep coaching to the next level and can now provide haptic alerts in the form of vibrations. In addition to mapping each of your sleep stages, it can now gently wake you up at the optimum time, making it one of <a href=#>the best sleep trackers on the market</a>.</p><h3 id=the-whoop-4-0-battery-pack-is-waterproof>4. The WHOOP 4.0 Battery Pack Is Waterproof</h3><p>No need to panic about getting your battery pack wet anymore because the WHOOP 4.0 portable battery pack is now waterproof and can even be used in the shower.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=whoop-4-0-monitors-blood-oxygen-levels>5. WHOOP 4.0 Monitors Blood Oxygen Levels</h3><p>Thanks to its upgraded LED configuration, the latest WHOOP can now also monitor your blood oxygen levels (SpO2). This, combined with its ability to monitor key metrics such as your heart rate, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability, makes it even better at providing an all-around picture of your health.</p><h3 id=whoop-4-0-monitors-skin-temperature>6. WHOOP 4.0 Monitors Skin Temperature</h3><p>But that’s not all. The WHOOP 4.0 also has a new skin temperature sensor, enabling it to better track your readiness to perform. The app can even notify you of any abnormal variations in your skin temperature, letting you know that you’re coming down with something before you start to feel sick.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-the-whoop-4-0-cost>How Much Does the WHOOP 4.0 Cost?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-2022-05-12-at-141811.jpg><p>With all this tech, surely the WHOOP 4.0 is extortionately expensive? Think again. WHOOP has made the WHOOP 4.0 accessible to all by offering a monthly membership option in which the WHOOP 4.0 device actually comes free.</p><p>With the basic Onyx wristband, you can purchase the WHOOP 4.0 for as little as $30 a month with no upfront cost, but you are tied into a 12-month minimum contract. If you have a bit of money saved up, then you can take out an annual membership for $300 upfront or a two-year membership for $480 upfront.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Of course, there’s also the option to upgrade your SuperKnit wristband to one of the more flashy colors, and there’s also a growing collection of WHOOP accessories waiting to tempt you at the checkout.</p><h3 id=do-you-need-a-whoop-membership-to-use-the-whoop-4-0>Do You Need a WHOOP Membership to Use the WHOOP 4.0?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WHOOP-Health-Monitor.png><p>The short answer to this is yes. Without a WHOOP membership, you won’t be able to access the WHOOP app, which means you won’t get personalized insights, coaching, or performance reports.</p><p>While some people may dislike the idea of needing a membership to use WHOOP, the membership model provides a lower-cost way for people to access advanced wearable technology – otherwise, there’d be a massive upfront cost.</p><h2 id=is-the-whoop-4-0-better-than-other-fitness-trackers>Is the Whoop 4.0 Better Than Other Fitness Trackers?</h2><p>If you’re looking for one of <a href=#>the best Apple watch models</a> or enjoy seeing the step count on your Fitbit, then the WHOOP 4.0 probably isn’t for you. However, if you’re interested in getting detailed insights about your body and are looking to learn how to train to perform at your best, then the WHOOP 4.0 is hard to beat.</p><p>If you’re unsure about WHOOP but want to give it a go, you can try it for free for 30-days. If you decide it’s not the right wearable for you, you won't be charged as long as you return your device within the 30-day window.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=monitoring-your-health-couldn-rsquo-t-be-easier-with-the-whoop-4-0>Monitoring Your Health Couldn’t Be Easier With the WHOOP 4.0</h2><p>Wearable technology has come a long way since the days of pedometers and basic EKGs with radio chest straps. Whether you’re training for a marathon or want to know more about your body, the WHOOP 4.0 makes it easier than ever to keep track of your health and fitness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiYm6elqXq1tMRmrqGnn6V6dXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chrissy-teigen-john-legend-epic-new-home-revealed.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chrissy Teigen and John Legends epic multi-million new home revealed</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./more-evidence-e-cigarettes-may-be-bad-you-scientists-say.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Prolonged heavy vaping may give you cancer, scientists say</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
