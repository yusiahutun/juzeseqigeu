"So he was wasting away. He just looked drained, he was just depleted, he wasn’t getting the nutrients."</p><p>The 50-year-old Hollywood megastar noted his son had "dark circles" under his eyes. "There was even a little greyness to his skin," he added. "We got really nervous. But you’re definitely looking better now."</p><p>Jaden has since moved over to a vegetarian diet from a strictly vegan regime - meaning he still doesn't consume meat but can have dairy among some other animal products.</p><p>"I also just wanna say that I’m vegetarian, that I’ve tried to be vegan. I’m vegetarian, you know, I’ve tried to eat vegan meals," Jaden said. "I’ll go vegan for a week or so but for the past year I’ve been vegetarian."</p><p>According to him, the main reason behind his poor diet was that he often skipped meals when he "didn't get around" to eating. "I was just eating like two meals a day... maybe one," he explained. "Maybe just that one big meal and I’m like, 'Oh, you know, I didn’t get around to it.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5mhuW62wJ2YZqudnsGpecWoqZydlGLAta3GnmSipqSav7exza2gqKZdqLyvecmam56mXai4qrqMrayrppWZeqi%2BxLJknaqRnrumsA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./42-facts-about-sammi-hanratty.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>42 Facts about Sammi Hanratty</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./remember-when-dwight-yoakam-played-grocery-store-employee-ellen.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Remember When Dwight Yoakam Helped Make Television History?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
