More specifically, I rarely polish my earring collection, which is ironic, considering earrings are the one piece of jewelry I consistently wear on a daily basis aside from my wedding rings. This is partially because I'm lazy when it comes to tedious tasks, but also because I never really learned how to clean earrings properly — and I have a feeling I'm not alone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For starters, it's important to know how often you should be tending to your accessories. Spoiler alert: It's probably (a lot) more often than you already do. Piercing experience manager at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Banter by Piercing Pagoda</a> Tim Bovasso tells InStyle that, ideally, you should clean any earrings you wear daily not just once a day, but twice a day — once in the morning and once at night. The same rules apply for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>earrings you wear only on occasion</a>. They should be cleaned before you wear them, and after you remove them to be stored, Bovasso says. Lastly, silver earrings should be cleaned "at least once a month even when not actively worn" because they tarnish naturally in exposed air.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If this is breaking news to you, rest assured you're not alone. But while such a rigorous polishing routine might sound over the top, Bovasso says not only is it important for the longevity of your jewelry, it's also important for sanitation purposes and good ear hygiene (infections are extremely common, IYKYK).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So now that you know how often you should be cleaning your earrings, the next step is to know how to clean your earrings properly to ensure you aren't damaging your jewelry. I asked a few experts in the space to share their best tips, below.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-understand-not-all-materials-are-treated-alike></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Understand Not All Materials Are Treated Alike</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Certain materials require a little more TLC beyond the time you dedicate to polishing them up, Justine Lançon, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Mejuri</a>'s chief creative officer, tells InStyle. For example, 18k vermeil is more durable than gold-filled jewelry, but Lançon says you'd have to remove the former before showering or working out. However, 14k solid gold will not oxidize or discolor from water exposure.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-be-gentle></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Be Gentle</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's a reason most jewelry comes with a tag stressing the items should be handled with care. According to Bovasso, this is especially true for earrings that contain more sensitive materials, like porous opals or silver that can easily oxidize. For these types of materials, you'll want to use gentle cleansers on the posts to remove any buildup of sebum, as well as Q-tips soaked in applicable solutions to clean tighter areas. "Avoid offsetting prongs or removing stones in the jewelry. Use a polishing cloth to shine exposed surfaces," Bovasso adds.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-for-silver-use-soap-and-water></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>For Silver: Use Soap and Water</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tarnishing is, unfortunately, inevitable on silver earrings (or any <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>silver jewelry</a>), especially once any additional coating like rhodium wears off, says Bovasso. However, "some people intentionally tarnish silver for a 'patina' look," he tells us. If your sterling silver earrings need a refresh, Bovasso says a gentle clean with soap (like a gentle dish soap) and warm water will remove any biological material from the accessory. If washing directly in the sink, be sure to use a drain catcher in case you accidentally drop one.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you'd ideally like to remove oxidization from silver entirely, there are specific silver cleaning chemicals that remove tarnish and won't damage the silver. However, these agents are slightly more abrasive than gold cleaning chemicals, so it's highly recommended that you use a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>jewelry polishing cloth</a> on broader surfaces of silver earrings.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-for-gold-and-fine-jewelry-do-a-gentle-soak></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>For Gold and Fine Jewelry: Do a Gentle Soak</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On a time crunch? CEO of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Clear Cut</a> Olivia Landau let us in on a little secret: You can soak your fine jewelry (earrings, pendants, necklaces, or anything that is platinum, 14K or 18K gold with diamonds) in a DIY solution of warm water and a pea-sized amount of dish soap. After 15 minutes, "use the toothbrush to gently brush any remaining dirt off — make sure to get into all the nooks and crannies," says Landau. "Rinse it under a sink with the drain covered, and finally pat dry with a paper towel."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another quick fix? <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Shinery Jewelry Radiance Wipes</a> ($22) which quickly and safely clean debris from gems such as pearls, opals, emeralds and turquoise.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-invest-in-a-jewelry-care-kit></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Invest in a Jewelry Care Kit</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Lançon, one of the easiest ways to stay on top of your earring hygiene is to invest in a jewelry care kit like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Mejuri Jewelry Care Kit</a>, which consists of a cleaning spray, a 100% cotton polishing cloth that's been treated with an anti-tarnishing agent, and a brush to help keep your pieces looking their best. In order to get the best results using these tools, Lançon says, "simply buff your pieces until any imperfections or marks are no longer visible." It's also important to be mindful of the materials your jewelry is made from when using anti-tarnishing agents in your routine. For example, Lançon warns against using the brand's polishing cloth on delicate gemstones, hard gemstones, pearls, black titanium, or purposefully oxidized jewelry.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-use-a-bling-brush-for-travel></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Use a Bling Brush for Travel</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Clear Cut makes a tool called the Bling Brush, which both Landau and this writer can't live without. "If you are on the go, you can use our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Bling Brush</a> so that your diamonds stay sparkly anytime," Landau tells InStyle. All you have to do is gently scrub the pen's soapy solution over your stones, rinse with warm water, and if you have the time, blow dry your jewels to enhance their glow. Trust us, it works every time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3yir8Keqqynop6ytHvHqK5mrJ9isK2xwKdknpmip7avs9I%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./finch-self-care-widget-pet-app.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Improve Your Self-Care Routine With the Finch App</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./galesburg-police-seek-information-on-park-vandalism.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Galesburg Police seek information on park vandalism</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
