There has also been an increase in the quality.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Overall, the quality of the designs is very good, much higher than in previous years,' Mr Liu said. 'Many of the products are very innovative. You can see they were not just targeted at the local market. They could be marketed all over the world. In the past, when you looked at a product, you could tell it was done by a local company. That is no longer true. There has been a great improvement in the quality of local design.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When it comes to product designers, Hong Kong has no shortage of talent. The Polytechnic University turns out many talented designers each year. Many locals go abroad to study design and return to practise their trade. Local companies also have no problem recruiting overseas graduates to work in Hong Kong, which is increasingly being seen as a design centre for Asia. Companies here are also able - and willing - to contract overseas design companies when necessary. 'A lot of young designers are coming out from overseas, especially England,' Mr Liu said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When it comes to research and development (R&D), however, it is a different story. Hong Kong has neither heavy industry nor a military, and this is where most of the basic research that eventually leads to product innovation takes place. As a result, companies must rely on research done at overseas universities, which they modify and incorporate into their own existing or new products to add value.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'We don't have enough good R&D people in Hong Kong,' Mr Liu said. 'When it comes to inventions, most Hong Kong companies will buy the technology from the United States, Japan or even China.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Three basic trends are taking place in consumer product design, and they are all part of a worldwide trend. In this regard, Hong Kong is a follower rather than a leader.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Hong Kong is like a microcosm of the world,' Mr Liu said. 'Whatever is popular on the other side of the world will become popular here.' The first trend is towards higher added value.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Mobile phones are a good example,' Mr Liu said. 'When you buy a mobile phone it is not just a mobile phone. It has to include such features as MP3, a digital camera, a personal digital assistant and sometimes even a radio.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The second is innovation. 'When consumers buy things, there are so many choices on the market that we want something innovative,' Mr Liu said. 'If there are several products with similar features, they will want something with an innovative design.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The third is size. 'Everything now needs to be portable,' Mr Liu said. 'If you go to Starbucks, you want to work on your notebook. That's why it has to be very small and very portable.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">High labour costs have forced companies in developed countries such as Japan and the United States to move much of their manufacturing to the mainland in recent years, and Hong Kong has been a part of this trend. As a result, companies that traditionally manufactured products to others' specifications are now having to come up with their own designs. For many companies, this has meant creating design and R&D departments.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'A few years ago, when people came to Hong Kong, they would ask: Can you make this for me? Now they should be asking: Do you have any good products you would like to show us?'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Hong Kong Awards for Industry play a key role in the perception of Hong Kong's design capabilities worldwide.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Some small companies have told us that before winning an award, they tried approaching both local and overseas companies, and nobody wanted to talk to them,' Mr Liu said. 'After they got the prize, the phone started ringing. Companies were approaching them.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Competition from the mainland - not to mention Vietnam, the Philippines and other countries in Southeast Asia - has not been lost on Hong Kong's consumer products sector. The sweatshops of old are giving way to increasingly sophisticated operations that are starting to attract talent from around the world - while leveraging the mainland's abundant land and cheap labour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The city has a long way to go before it becomes known as a design centre on a par with the United States or Japan, but it is headed in the right direction.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdkbIVzfpdon6RllJrAqrPNrGSaqpViv6atw7JkrZmbmnq4u9Glmw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./montgomery-clift-actor-untold-story-hollywood.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Montgomery Clift: the untold story of Hollywood's misunderstood star</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./5-things-know-about-k-pop-star-teddy-bear-seulgi-her.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>5 things to know about K-pop idol Seulgi, girl group Red Velvet's Teddy Bear</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
