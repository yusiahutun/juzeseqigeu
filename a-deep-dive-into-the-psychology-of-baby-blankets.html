The object may be a tiny blanket, a stuffed animal, or even a small pillow. We sleep with it every night, and it accompanies us on even international trips. Taking that object along with us everywhere is non-negotiable. We entertain no requests to donate it, throw it away, or even replace it with a new, identical one. Have you ever wondered why we develop such a strong attachment to some objects? And, if it is normal? Let’s look at how <a href=#>psychology</a> answers these questions.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>The Basics of Child Psychology</a></strong></p><p>What are baby blankets, and what role do they play in a child’s development? Objects like baby blankets, stuffed animals, and toys are known as comfort objects. In the formal terminology of developmental psychology, they are referred to as transitional objects. This term was coined by the psychologist <strong>DW Winnicott</strong> in 1951, who explained their role in the growth and development of a child.</p><p>Infants, in their early months, do not differentiate the world in terms of internal reality and external reality. They exist in a state of complete dependence on their mothers, and they see themselves and their mothers as a whole. Gradually, the child begins to separate the ‘me’ from the ‘not-me’, and realises that the mother is a separate entity. The child moves to a state of relative independence. This is a difficult phase for the child and can bring a lot of frustration and <a href=#>anxiety</a>. They have a sense of losing something.</p><p>In this process, transitional objects play a very important role. They become the tools through which a child transitions from dependence to independence. Baby blankets, stuffed toys, pacifiers, dolls, pillows, and other such objects, become the first ‘not-me’ object that a child comes to possess. This object replaces the mother-child bond, provides a sense of comfort and security to the child, and relieves anxiety about separation from the mother. Such objects are especially helpful for children who have a strong fear of the night and darkness, and those with great separation anxiety.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>Impact of Parental Abuse on Child Development</a></strong></p><p>The use of comfort objects is the greatest around two to three years of age. Children in a lot of play schools can be seen carrying the objects with them to class and performing each activity with them. After that, children may still be attached to their objects, but slowly stop carrying them around everywhere.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Is it Normal for Adults to Hold on to their childhood comfort objects?</h4><p>In a poll conducted by Travelodge in Britain, out of 6,000 adults, about 35% of people tucked themselves into <a href=#>sleep</a> with a comfort object. So, you are not alone if you can’t have a good night’s sleep without your comfort object!</p><p>People see such a habit as a sign of weakness and insecurity, but this is simply a false notion. There is no harm in being attached to childhood objects, as they can help with anxiety and soothe adults too. They can be essential to your mental well-being, especially in times of transition and big changes in adulthood, such as moving cities, starting a new job, or experiencing significant loss.</p><p>However, if an adult’s dependence on transitional objects is intense, there may be a pathological reason behind it. Such people are more susceptible to developing <a href=#>Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)</a>. They may have difficult and unstable interpersonal relationships, trouble being alone, and an inability to soothe themselves in times of distress. This usually stems from experiences of <a href=#>trauma</a> or neglect during childhood, when their caregivers did not support them adequately and may lead to attachment problems in adulthood as well. Thus, if you rely on comfort objects too heavily, it may be a good idea to contact a <a href=#>therapist</a>.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Is the phenomenon of transitional objects universal?</h4><p>The attachment of a child to their comfort objects depends upon the circumstances in which they were raised. Children develop strong attachments to transitional objects if they are made to sleep away from their parents at an early age, as is the case in the Western world. The instances of children being strongly attached to comfort objects in Indian society (also Korean and Italian) are relatively lesser, as children usually spend early childhood in close contact with their mother, and also have many other caregivers in a joint family setup. However, in contemporary times, as more and more nuclear families become the norm, the attachment to comfort objects is also increasing.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>What are some other uses of transitional objects?</h4><p>Comfort objects have a therapeutic use as well. Sometimes, ambulances and emergency vehicles are equipped with soft blankets, stuffed toys, and other such objects to be given to people who have experienced a traumatic event to provide them with comfort. Charities also provide these objects to survivors of natural disasters. Thus, we have seen the importance of the role played by transitional objects in the healthy development of children, and how it is perfectly normal to continue being attached to these objects in adulthood as well. You can now enjoy cuddling with your favourite teddy bear or sleeping with your beloved blankie in peace!</p><p>Read More Articles from Psychologs</p>References +<ul><li>https://www.theswaddle.com/is-this-normal-i-still-sniff-my-childhood-blanket-to-fall-asleep-transitional-objects</li><li>https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-guest-room/201407/more-just-teddy-bears?amp</li><li>https://amp.theguardian.com/science/2007/mar/09/psychology.uknews</li><li>https://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9049687/childhood-blanket-transition</li></ul><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Life Style</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>The Psychology of Routine: Experts Insights</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Life Style</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Small Yet Significant Ways to Grow as a</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Life Style</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>“From being peaceful to into pieces”: The Inner</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 28, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Life Style</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Mindful Eating: A Path to Healthier Relationships with</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 25, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Life Style</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Exercise Addiction: Balancing the Benefits and Risks for</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 22, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2BcwG%2BvzqZmmmWUmrKxecOirZ5lmaPBsHnToZxmqKOusKm7y6iesmWfm3qjrcGyZJukkaO4psDSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./being-who-you-are-will-be-enough-singer-stefanie-sun-laments-looming-ai-threat-fakes-make-her-viral.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Being who you are will be enough: singer Stefanie Sun laments looming AI threat as</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./crystal-beauty-products.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Crystal Beauty Products Actually Take Your Routine to the Next Level</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
