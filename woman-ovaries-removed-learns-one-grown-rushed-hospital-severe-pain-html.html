She also had a second&nbsp;laparotomy.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>For five years, all of Meg's cysts developed on her right ovary. So, at the age of 21, she made the decision to have that ovary removed.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Initially relieved to be putting the ideal behind her, Meg was 'devastated' when, two weeks after having her right ovary removed, she developed her first cyst on her left ovary.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Not quite ready to remove that one too, and lose her last chance of conceiving a biological child, Meg juggled birth control, hormones, and anti-inflammatory pills to quell her pain. However, she says, nothing seemed to work, and she resigned herself to the fact that she would have to struggle with health issues for the rest of her life.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>A few years later, when she was 26, her pelvic pain specialist was removing more endometriosis and scar tissue when he found that her ovary had 'twisted itself into a ball' behind her uterus. A large mass of scar tissue had also formed around metal staples which a previous doctor had unintentionally left inside of her. Removing them provided her with some relief.</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/06/10/10/297FDAB700000578-0-image-a-42_1433928146896.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>The woman terrified of vomit: Teacher refuses to have...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/06/09/16/297A61A900000578-0-image-m-84_1433865062999.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Woman gives birth using ovary tissue frozen when she was a...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span> <img id=i-a648a85bf67cfaff src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/06/11/21/298B07AD00000578-3120626-image-a-41_1434056327651.jpg height=535 width=634 alt="Happy surprise: Though she was told that she would never be able to conceive a child without using IVF, Meg - down to just one ovary - became pregnant with a daughter" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Happy surprise: Though she was told that she would never be able to conceive a child without using IVF, Meg - down to just one ovary - became pregnant with a daughter</p><img id=i-96593a366617e397 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/06/11/21/298B07B600000578-3120626-image-a-42_1434056332061.jpg height=1127 width=634 alt="Rocky pregnancy: Meg suffered from preeclampsia during her pregnancy with her daughter, right, who was born 13 weeks early" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Rocky pregnancy: Meg suffered from preeclampsia during her pregnancy with her daughter, right, who was born 13 weeks early</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>But the surprises weren't over.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Through all of Meg's doctor visits, she had been told that she would never be able to have a baby without the help of IVF. So when she missed a month of birth control due to an insurance mix-up, she wasn't worried. She believed that her unhealthy ovaries were birth control enough.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>However, soon after her month off the pill, Meg learned she was pregnant.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>While she had managed, against all odds, to conceive naturally, her pregnancy was not without issues, including preeclampsia&nbsp;and bed rest. Her daughter was born 13 weeks early.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>After her unexpected pregnancy, Meg believed that she could now rid herself of her issues once and for all. In the past, she had hesitated to get a hysterectomy because she was still holding out hope that she would one day have a child. Now that she had one, she could go through with the major surgery.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Her gynecologist removed her uterus, but left her last ovary alone. Both Meg and her doctor hoped she would have no complications.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>But two weeks later, that ovary developed another grapefruit-sized cyst. Doctors finally removed that one too.</span></p><img id=i-9fd23bed13df9a28 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/06/11/21/298B07BA00000578-3120626-image-a-43_1434056341307.jpg height=951 width=634 alt="Unusual ovaries: After her ovary grew back, Meg was told she has Ovarian Remnant Syndrome, a very rare disorder in which ovarian tissue regenerates itself" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Unusual ovaries: After her ovary grew back, Meg was told she has Ovarian Remnant Syndrome, a very rare disorder in which ovarian tissue regenerates itself</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Finally, after years of surgeries and pain, Meg was sure her ordeal was over. After all, she no longer had ovaries or a uterus.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Or so she thought. Three months after her second ovary was removed, she was back in the hospital with more abdominal pain. A doctor told her she had an ovarian cyst.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Meg said that that was impossible, as she didn't actually have ovaries anymore.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The doctor explained that she had&nbsp;Ovarian Remnant Syndrome. A tiny bit of her ovarian tissue had been left behind when it was removed and, in a rare twist, it regenerated itself.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'My chances of developing it were like one in a million,' she says.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Meg had the remnants removed, but she will no longer let herself believe that she has seen the last of her health problems. She is still experiencing issues with endometriosis, and is afraid that she'll 'end up growing sideshow starfish ovaries again', referencing how the marine animal can regrow lost or damaged arms.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Still, she says her pain levels are down - she puts them at a four out of ten - and adds that that's 'huge' for her.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn%2BQa2dvamZkpLC5wKdkqK6Rp7amv4yrnKanppqxbrjEmqmnq12ku6Z5pouGkIZdp8K0tMSdZKGno6W2ta3LZqqerpWnsm68wKKlZ6Ckork%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./modern-female-country-trailblazers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>25 Modern Female Artists Changing Country Music</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./omar-slim-white.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Omar &amp;quot;Slim&amp;quot; White dating?
