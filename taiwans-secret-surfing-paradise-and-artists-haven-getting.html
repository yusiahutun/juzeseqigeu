It was once accessible only by ship, with tall waves crashing on long stretches of black and amber sand, lined with tangles of driftwood stripped bare, and seas promising high winter swells.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/11/29/53ffdf5c-d10b-11e7-986f-48a2e310a482_1320x770_102628.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a result of its relative remoteness, forbidding coastline, and at times tempestuous seas, Taitung was the last morsel of country to be colonised by Han Chinese immigrants in the late 19th century.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even today, in low season there is a touch of the “raw”, as the immigrants of the Qin dynasty used to refer to those inhabitants who had yet to submit to their colonial rule. But word is getting out, and while in high season the tour buses use Highway 11 with regularity, it could soon be a place swelling year-round with travellers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/11/29/4e0e69e2-d10b-11e7-986f-48a2e310a482_1320x770_102628.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Maybe it’s the somewhat cumbersome transport shuffle that keeps Dulan from tearing at the seams with day trippers. Still, there’s something of a small international scene forming there.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On a Saturday night, a part of that scene of artists, artisans, surfers and digital nomads converges on Highway 11, a bar at the Sintung Sugar Factory Culture Park, run by American expatriate Brian Curran. He’s closing in on the two-decade mark in Taiwan, and has owned the bar for the past three.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Michelin Guide Taipei set to raise profile of a foodie paradise that’s stayed below the radar until now</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Ten years ago, you met a foreigner, it’d be an English teacher or a businessman.

Now I know pro riders, punk rockers, surfers.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/11/29/5961aca0-d10b-11e7-986f-48a2e310a482_1320x770_102628.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Surfing is one of the main draws of Dulan.

All you have to do is drop in and ask, and they will point you in the right direction, rent you equipment or sell you a surf lesson package.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hanna Chen, a twenty-something from Kaohsiung working at Donghe’s Taitung Surf Shop and Hostel, came and stayed for the surfing three years ago. The waves are always big from October to February, she says, but people can surf all year round.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/11/29/489cf5aa-d10b-11e7-986f-48a2e310a482_1320x770_102628.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chen says the river mouth break at Jinzun, about 20 minutes north of Dulan by scooter, is among the area’s best; the crescent of black sand just south of a small fishing harbour sits nearly empty on a grey on a recent autumn Sunday afternoon, even though the waves are welcoming.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chenggong Township, further to the North, has a place known to the locals as Kee Hui Point, which is in surfing terms, a left reef break. It’s spoken of as the best break in the country, though it only gets about a month’s worth of surf-able waves in a given year, mostly when the category four or five typhoon winds blow in from the east or the southeast.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">There’s a lot of different kind of surfers who come here.

The surfing side of things is handled by 40-year-old South African Mark Jackson. An old-school purist who’s quick with the help and advice, Jackson runs the yearly Wave Jam, a friendly gathering of surfers from Taiwan and abroad on Dulan Bay, in front of Cape Cafe.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the jam, awards are handed out for dubious accomplishments like “Biggest Wipeout” and others with names such as the Nuclear Award that seems to go to the craziest competitor, willing to slug it out in the gnarliest of conditions, and the Piece of Cake Award for the one who makes the impossible look like the routine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This year’s jam, also known as the Taitung Wave Classic, got going in early November, and ran on an impromptu basis, when the waves and the winter winds cooperated, for much of the month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/11/29/42793b98-d10b-11e7-986f-48a2e310a482_1320x770_102628.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jackson, a Taitung county resident since 2005, has been running the surf school for the past five years. “The last couple of years it’s been quite steady,” he says, after a somewhat sporadic start to the business. “There’s a lot of different kind of surfers who come here. In summer it’s beginners, all kinds but a lot more Taiwanese. From October onwards until March, April, it’s more experienced guys. We had a six-metre swell this weekend.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jackson is among a small crew of expats who have set up shop in Dulan for the long haul, drawn by the easy-going, slow-paced small town vibrations – the kind of spot where you come across a band holding an impromptu jam session at the Sugar Factory tea shop on a Sunday night, after being inspired by the driftwood sculpture pieces of indigenous artist Siki Sufin or kayaking among the tumbled down boulders worn smooth beneath Donghe Bridge, by day.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Seven of the best waterborne holiday adventures in Asia</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among those expatriates is 55-year-old Frenchman Patrick Guillou.

Though it remains relatively uncrowded, Guillou says, that could soon change.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Seven of the best underwater cameras for your next snorkelling or scuba dive trip</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Three years ago, the tourists stayed one day.
