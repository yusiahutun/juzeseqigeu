Back home in the American south, across from the family homestead, was 400 acres (161 hectares) of cow pasture. His property was a few acres, mostly forest save a humble home with a wood-burning stove for heat and hot water.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/04/23/9c52d056-6198-11e9-b745-17e2afcf325c_1320x770_153110.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At age 10, tragedy struck when his mother passed away. About the same time his father, now a single parent, was struck by a digestive problem that sapped much of his strength. For about a decade, any forays into the wilderness were put on hold.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In his early 20s, Leiss went on a couple of long-term, round-the-world backpacking trips, hitting East Africa, Asia, Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia and the North American continent.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hikes near Taipei: challenge yourself on one of region’s most difficult day hikes</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Between trips he joined his brother, who at the time was working as a teacher with a travelling circus that meandered around the US via rail, teaching the children of circus performers during the day while their parents were busy practising and putting on a show for the fans. While his brother was in the mobile classroom, Leiss tended a booth selling snow cones.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You work for 18 hours and you make like US$70. It’s super exploitative,” he recalls, though the bitterness of the memory fails to dampen his naturally bright disposition. The circus, he says, has since shut down, owing to the public’s growing distaste for entertainment at the expense of animal welfare. Ironically, however, he says, “The animals were treated a lot better than the people.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The idea of running away and joining the circus did not appeal to Leiss, and he spent only a few months with the troupe. During the course of further travel he settled for a while to study at a university in Kathmandu, Nepal. After a stint in Israel and in Hangzhou, China, working in a hotel and teaching English respectively, seven years ago Leiss set his eyes on Taiwan for the first time, and – landing in the southern port city of Kaohsiung – liked what he saw.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/04/23/9e4fda3e-6198-11e9-b745-17e2afcf325c_1320x770_153110.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He studied Chinese and eventually signed up for a four-year university programme. He also started getting back into hiking, finding a website run by Taiwan-based travel writer Kirk Beiser that specialised in Taiwan's waterfalls.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He had like 50 waterfalls on his site. I went to all 50 of them. And I was like, ‘Now what do I do?’” Leiss says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hitting those first 50 took about a year. After that, he decided to set up his own website, documenting his adventures. Leiss has since visited over 300 waterfalls throughout Taiwan – getting into a few dangerous situations along the way. A trip to Ali Waterfall, one of southern Taiwan’s tallest cascades, saw him dangling precariously over a high precipice as he made the final push towards the column of water.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/04/23/9b8a9974-6198-11e9-b745-17e2afcf325c_1320x770_153110.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There were two pegs in the wall,” he says of a traverse he had to make across a washed out section of a long-abandoned road, a relic of the Japanese-era logging industry, “and a rotten, slimy rope that you should definitely not put your weight on. We just grabbed it and crossed, leaning over an 80-metre (262-feet) cliff on a rotten rope. It was a really stupid idea.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hiking an active Indonesian volcano</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Thanks to his intrepid nature and willingness to share lesser-known locations with the public, Leiss now has hundreds of thousands of online followers. Soon, his site will be open to other contributors for the first time, as his list of places he wants to visit has ballooned well into the thousands.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is a number he cannot possibly manage on his own, especially since the landscape and routes can change due to heavy rain and he wants all the information on his site to be kept up-to-date.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It can happen overnight. You never see the same places twice. There are lakes that form and disappear.

From the van, he can edit his new YouTube series that documents his travels around Taiwan and includes various guests, hiking and shots of Leiss partaking in other activities.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The best things to do on a Taipei layover, from stinky tofu to tea</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is a mammoth undertaking for one man, and he is not averse to seeking outside help at some point. But thus far, he has made it all work on his own. As for possibly slowing down, maybe visiting fewer places, settling down?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Not gonna happen,” he says with a smile. Taiwan simply has too much left to offer for a man with a wandering spirit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/04/23/9d7f43e2-6198-11e9-b745-17e2afcf325c_1320x770_153110.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Xiaofei’s top Taipei area waterfalls and swimming holes</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">1.

There is a natural water slide there in Wulai – a proper water slide – and it wasn’t there five years ago.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From Taipei’s Xindian MRT Station, catch the 849 bus on Beixin Road, which takes about an hour to get to your next stop, Chenggong. From Chenggong, it’s about a 45-minute hike to the water slide, located at the following GPS coordinates: 24.87771, 121.5287.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Get away from it all on Taiwan’s east coast</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">2.

You’ve got to go,” says Leiss. “It's like a slot canyon, about 100 metres (323 feet) long and 15 metres (49 feet) high. You just swim through it. It’'s a really cool experience.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To find it, head to the Muzha MRT Station in Taipei, and from there walk about 200 metres (656 feet) to the Bojia Elementary School Bus Stop. Then, get on the 795 Extend Shifen Bus, and take that to the Fengqiaotou stop. The Wormhole is located less than 100 metres from the bus stop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/04/23/9eda64ba-6198-11e9-b745-17e2afcf325c_1320x770_153110.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">3.

Transfer to the 4728 to Jingtong, and get off at the Lingjiao stop. From Lingjiao Station, it’s about a two-minute walk to Lingjiao waterfall.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Chasing waterfalls</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZMGzrdWeo2aklZ7Atr7EaJirrJmYuaZ7kmlncGplbnyptcqipaBlpJa2uK3NrGSwmaSav6ety6WqZqCfqXq0vNGipaCrXaGurLHSZpinnF2oxKq5zKKloA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./henry-zebrowski-married-wife-family-age-net-worth-height-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Henry Zebrowski Married, Wife, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./faith-majors.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Faith Majors dating?
