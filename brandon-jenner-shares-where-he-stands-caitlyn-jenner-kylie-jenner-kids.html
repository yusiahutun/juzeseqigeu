"We have a lot of things in common. ... We're both pilots, so we share a hanger, and we're up there at least a couple times a week working on planes and flying and stuff. So, we're very good friends and we have a great relationship, definitely better than it's ever been, or just more close than it's ever been, which is nice."</p><p>Brandon's wife, Cayley Jenner, with whom he shares 3-year-old twin boys, told Us Weekly that their sons have a nickname for Caitlyn, and refer to her as "Boom Boom."</p><p>"Boom Boom's present and the kids ask about her and want to see her, and they love to see her when she's around," she said. "So, it's really nice."</p><p>Brandon and his younger brother, <a href=#><strong>Brody Jenner</strong></a>, are the sons of Caitlyn and his ex-wife Linda Thompson. Both have <a href=#><strong>spoken out in the past</strong></a> about how they had strained relationships with Caitlyn, saying their father didn't spend much time with them growing up, especially after she married <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a> in 1991. (Caitlyn and Kris, of course, are parents to Kendall and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://toofab.com/people/kylie-jenner><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>, now 28 and 26, respectively, and the former couple split in 2013, and divorced in 2015.)</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Fortunately, due to what he shared in his new interview, it looks like Brandon and Caitlyn were able to repair their relationship in recent years.</p><p>Meanwhile, Brandon -- who is also dad to 8-year-old daughter Eva from his previous relationship with Leah James -- revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Us Weekly </strong></a>that his children have met his half-sister Kylie Jenner's kids: Stormi, 5, and Aire, who turns two in February.</p><p>"They've met, but we haven’t spent that much time [together] recently," he said. "We're just all super busy. You have the intention where you're just like, 'Yeah, let's do this.'"</p><p>Brandon noted that while "life gets in the way," he and Kylie "plan" for their kids to spend more time together.</p><p>Brandon also opened up about his approach to fatherhood, sharing how he's raising his kids "differently" than his parents. The dad of three said he tries to "just be really present" as a father.</p><p>"Both my parents, my mom and my dad, were really busy when I was growing up," he explained.</p><a id=gallery-link-8337fb39-bb2e-4598-ae89-5f71cefa638a class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:8337fb39-bb2e-4598-ae89-5f71cefa638a data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:bc4a20f4-8030-49be-a8c4-0eff2fba5856 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/30/4by3/2024/01/04/301e949192f94e9e98edd78025abbb73_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pma29fl7%2BiusOopWailaO7pr6MrJ%2BaqpWoeri0xKucZqCVYsC1rc2dqmabkZ7BrcXNZqGepp6av2632KWgnmWamruvsdFmoqKco2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./planet-positive.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Planet Positive</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./are-cornrows-cool-again.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Are Cornrows Cool Again?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
