The couple and their kids can relax and unwind as much as they'd like at their rural weekend retreat outside of Nashville, which features an amazing barn-themed house that is a perfect home away from home.</p><p>Rhett's rural property about 30 minutes outside of Nashville is a 126-acre spread with an enormous man-made lake. A cozy guest cottage sits right at the edge of the lake, but the main feature of the property is a rustic, yet luxurious barn home that provides effortless indoor-outdoor living, perfect for getting away from every care of the workweek.</p><p>Renowned architect Bobby McAlpine designed the spectacular one-of-a-kind space with his interior design partner, Ray Booth, and Rhett and Akins invited <a href=#>Country Living</a> into their private retreat.</p><p>The barn is designed to hold farm equipment, dirt bikes, off-road vehicles or any other kind of entertainment or work vehicles imaginable, and the property&nbsp;— which was designed around the concept of "family togetherness"&nbsp;— features seamless transitions from indoor to outdoor spaces, as well as 3-4 miles of professionally graded trails that are accessible by automobile, ATV, on horseback or on foot.</p><p>The massive parcel of land also boasts a horse pasture, a skeet shooting area and a hot tub, as well as covered and uncovered outdoor nooks and spaces that open out to expansive rural views.</p><p>The barn home's floors are acid-washed and stained concrete, and the space features floor-to-ceiling windows, poplar accents with exposed beams, a unique suspended, swinging sofa and more. Sliding barn doors give way to a chef's kitchen with two sets of sub-zero refrigerators, a six-burner gas cooktop and more. The downstairs master bedroom features his-and-her vanities and both an indoor shower and a private outdoor shower, while the upstairs open-air loft features custom bunk beds and offers a breathtaking view of the lush surrounding hills.</p><p>The waterfront guest cottage is a small, but exceptionally cozy space with a fireplace, a breakfast area with floor-to-ceiling windows and a perfectly-sized sleeping nook.</p><p>The property sold for $4.7 million in 2016.
