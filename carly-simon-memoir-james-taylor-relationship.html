I was spending time with Mick Jagger and Ronnie Wood at the Plaza hotel in New York, around the corner from Earl’s apartment. One evening while the boys were recording in a studio downtown, Earl thought I might prefer to come to a party he was hosting. Carly and James Taylor were there, and she and I hit it off instantly. As we looked alike in profile and both had long legs, which we liked to curl up beneath ourselves when gossiping on a sofa, we soon had our moniker.</p><img alt="carinthia west carly simon" title="carinthia west carly simon" width=1889 height=1920 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz030120featcarlysimon-02-1581527650.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">.</span><p>Carinthia West with Hercules Bellville and Carly Simon, circa 1980</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One of the funniest times I had with Carly occurred on her sofa when I arrived from England jet-lagged, and she told me why she had written “You’re So Vain” and who it was about, only to discover that I was fast asleep and had missed every word. Fortunately she later divulged that the middle stanza was about Warren Beatty, an affair recounted hilariously in her best-selling 2015 memoir, Boys in the Trees. After a late-night tryst, Warren rushes off at 5 a.m. claiming he is working on his latest film. Carly goes to visit her therapist for a morning session, and in the middle of discussing Warren, the therapist turns pale and tells her, “You are not the first patient of the day who spent the night with Warren Beatty last night.”</p><img alt="carly simon james taylor" title="carly simon james taylor" width=3000 height=2008 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz030120featcarlysimon-01-1581527915.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Paul R Benoit/AP/Shutterstock</span><p>Simon with Warren Beatty, 1984</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Settling down once again on this very couch in her light-filled living room, with her own still-life watercolors of pears on the mantel while a crackly wood fire burns below, we get to talking about her Carnegie Hall tribute concert, which will raise funds for music education programs for underprivileged children. The vaunted music venue holds a very special place in Carly’s heart. “I have a wonderful history with Carnegie Hall,” she says.“I opened for Cat Stevens there in 1971. I met James there that same year when I went to his dressing room to say hello and he invited himself to my home for a late-night lunch that expanded into a life together.” This fateful coup de foudre is described in Boys in the Trees as they progressed through marriage, two children, hugely popular concert duets like “Mockingbird,” and, ultimately, a very public divorce.</p><img alt="carly simon james taylor" title="carly simon james taylor" width=3600 height=2820 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz030120featcarlysimon-04-1581528112.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Richard E. Aaron</span><p>Simon and James Taylor, 1978</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Carly winces and shifts her body on the sofa as her affectionate Cavapoo, Aja, jumps onto her legs. She’s been dealing with a broken hip as well as two painful knee joints. “Both of my knees need to be replaced with pearls!” she says. “They’ll soon have an app where you’ll have a choice of knee shapes and you’d be able to change their color or the song you’d like them to sing.” Like “Haven’t Got Time for the Pain”? I ask. “Well, my real pain is emotional and often centered around James,” she replies.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I am reminded of a line in her memoir of their Carnegie Hall meeting: “Once I laid eyes on James, a sense of possession overtook me, as if a dog fence of little white flags had sprung out of the ground around him. The women on the periphery knew just how far back they must stay.” Perhaps a secret of the success of our friendship is that we’ve never crossed the line into the other’s more serious relationships, especially with James, whom I knew but kept a careful distance from. “Yes, there is a kind of territorial clutch that happens around my heart,” she says. “But you and I have a special bond. I used to think you couldn’t make friends after you were 30, and I met you when I was about 31. I always felt you were the taller, more beautiful, younger me!” Notwithstanding the outrageously flattering compliment, it is true that over the years we’ve sometimes been mistaken for each other; the photographer and art collector Jean Pigozzi once published a photo of my legs with a caption saying they belonged to Carly.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>There is a kind of territorial clutch that happens around my heart.<br>— Carly Simon<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We’ve always had that kind of best-girlfriend relationship. There were late nights with her playing piano or guitar. There were secret discussions about our great loves and various entanglements. We never argued and only once fancied the same man, a fatally seductive and successful screenwriter, albeit at different times. “Remember when you started dating him a year after me and you found the ballet shoes in his kitchen bin?” Carly laughs. “I’d told you he was a bit of a wolf and warned you off him!” She was passionate in my defense when I was dumped by a director boyfriend for a glamorous actress, muttering “bastard!” when she next saw him. And I was never afraid to tell her what I thought.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although I didn’t know her then, I could never quite understand Carly’s early passion for the celebrated English author Willie Donaldson. She met him in 1965 on a trip to England and fell in love. He left the actress Sarah Miles for her, saying at the time, “[She’s] the answer to any sane man’s prayers: funny, quick, erotic, extravagantly talented,” but soon jilted Carly and went back to Miles. Carly forgave him and sent me to meet him some 20 years later. He clearly still held a torch for Carly, but though I was amused by him I reported back to her, rather disparagingly, that I couldn’t understand her fascination for a man who wore scruffy brown jackets with those hideous patches at the elbows. She is still incredulous. “That’s so interesting that you didn’t find Willie attractive!” she exclaims.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Both of us got married again, she to the writer Jim Hart, and I to a man who swept me off to the English countryside. More recently she met Richard Koehler, a surgeon who also loves to sail. “Richard is such a romantic!” she says. “His mother wrote romance novels for Harlequin under several different noms de plume. He has her energy and gets done in five minutes what would take me five weeks.” (Later, when I ask Richard if, after 13 years, he and Carly might one day marry, he replies, “We’ve both been married twice before, so it’s either going to be third time’s a charm or three strikes and you’re out!”)</p><img alt="Carly Simon Richard Koehler" title="Carly Simon Richard Koehler" width=1993 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz030120featcarlysimon-03-1581527506.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Joe Corrigan</span><p>Simon with her partner, Richard Koehler, 2010</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“You have a choice when you write a book about yourself as to how much is going to be true and how much is exaggerated or left out,” Carly says. “It’s the conflict between vulnerability and mystery. And wanting to show one’s vulnerability is not quite as sexy as being mysterious. Yet what I really have to offer is my truth.” I comment that I had read an article on rock memoirs that praised the books of Keith Richards and Elton John while noting that the penultimate “superstar catch” for a book publisher would be Mick or Warren, as neither has been keen to divulge his secrets so far, and Mick once famously returned the advance he’d received to write his autobiography. “The problem is that each person who writes their memoir has to outshock the last person, so therefore the bar becomes higher for you to put in interesting things, memorable things, slimy, sleazy, possible lies,” she says. “Who knows? If I write another and veer off wildly from the truth of my life, I might as well make it a novel.”</p><img alt="Mick Jagger" title="Mick Jagger" width=4366 height=2951 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz030120featcarlysimon-05-1581527598.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Lynn Goldsmith</span><p>Mick Jagger, circa 1981</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Earlier in the day, Carly played me some outtakes from the 1972 studio session, only recently surfaced, in which Mick sang backup on “You’re So Vain.” It’s soothing to hear the easy banter between them as they croon a few bars of a country and western song. Later that evening I show her and Richard a clip from an upcoming documentary about my photographic work. Mick features in it, generously having agreed to be interviewed, and she comments on what a gift of friendship that is to me. She’s not sure about her own friendship with Mick. “I hope he’s not mad at me. He asked for no credit on ‘You’re So Vain,’ but I feel I should have given him an honorary prize for a record that may have gone down the tubes otherwise.” Warren, the subject of that second stanza, has been married to Annette Bening for more than two decades, and with Carly so happy with Richard, I confess my own longing (post- divorce) to be in one more loving relationship before I hang up my dating shoes. “You must get on Mates or one of those Web sites,” she says, and brightens enthusiastically at the thought of a bit of amateur matchmaking. “Or I could pretend to be you!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001THPA1M/ data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Get the latest issue of the BAZAAR" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-product-id=d90baeb3-32be-452d-9ac7-4c2e33ce6d7f data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001THPA1M/ data-product-url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001THPA1M/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001THPA1M/ data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand="Hearst Magazines" data-vars-ga-product-price=$7.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=7702bb5f-2eef-4250-be29-dfff35ad9edd data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Hearst Magazines" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=Women class="body-btn-link product-links-button css-1xbq6k6 e1aq0z090">Get the latest issue of the BAZAAR</a><br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This article originally appears in the March 2020 issue of Harper’s BAZAAR, available on newsstands February 18.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX5aAcYORbGhtaV%2BYrrO42GaqoqWfo3quscyooKtlmpa6pr%2BMrZiypJ%2BnerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./traitors-recap-does-peter-join-round-table-twist.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Does Peter Join Dark Side?
