They brought a special gift to Claire’s parents and Steve and me from there, clay oil lamps from the time of Christ. The one I’m holding is theirs but I had to show you how tiny they are and how small the extra oil vase is that sits on the top of the lamp. They know how much I love the parable of the 10 virgins in the book of Matthew—I even have a painting in my home—and this lamp is the perfect reminder to keep our lamps full! In the parable, only those with enough oil for their lamps were able to enter the house of the bridegroom. For modern time interpretation, the oil is symbolic as being spiritually prepared, not just for the second coming but for our everyday lives. In Biblical times, since the lamps were so small, constant effort was needed to insure that an adequate amount of oil was made available for their lamps to get through the night. Today, we need to make a constant effort to keep our “spiritual oil” maintained and full in our lamps. The Lord commanded the children of Israel anciently to use “pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually” (Leviticus 24:2). Olive oil was a symbol of purity and for the presence and influence of the Holy Ghost. That same spiritual influence is what guides us and inspires us to “keep our lamps full” 🪔 Go to my Facebook page or marieosmond.com/sundaymessage to read my full #SundayMessage! It was interesting to me that on the way to Lake Charles, Louisiana for my concert this weekend we had to use the GPS on my phone to figure out where we were going! I was so grateful I had just enough battery left on my phone to do that. I suddenly made a fun symbolic connection with the oil lamp and my phones GPS. I realized I couldn’t get to the hotel or really ANYWHERE without my GPS! 🤣 And through my daily effort to put oil in my “spiritual GPS” I will be able to find my way back home!!! After all… there’s no place like home! #HappySunday</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>Marie Osmond</a> (@marieosmond) on Feb 16, 2020 at 4:03pm PST</p><p>The “Paper Roses” songstress — who is the proud mom of Stephen, 36, as well as <a href=#>Jessica Blosil</a>, 32, <a href=#>Rachael Krueger</a>, 30, Brandon, 23, Brianna, 22, Matthew, 20, Abigail, 17, and <a href=#>late son Michael</a> — explained why being gifted the clay oil lamps was such a meaningful gesture.</p><p>“They know how much I love the parable of the 10 virgins in the book of Matthew — I even have a painting in my home — and this lamp is the perfect reminder to keep our lamps full!” the <a href=#>Talk</a> cohost continued. “In the parable, only those with enough oil for their lamps were able to enter the house of the bridegroom. For modern time interpretation, the oil is symbolic as being spiritually prepared, not just for the second coming but for our everyday lives.”</p><p>In the remainder of her lengthy caption, Marie detailed how the clay oil lamps are used to “keep our ‘spiritual oil’ maintained.” How cool!</p><p>Considering the&nbsp;<a href=#>Donny & Marie</a>&nbsp;star is one of Hollywood’s most doting mamas, it’s no surprise she took advantage of being able to gush over her kids. However, now that her big brood of children are getting older, Marie has had her hands full being a proud grandmother. She even told Closer Weekly&nbsp;all about how <a href=#>she’ll do just about “anything”</a> to put a smile on their little faces.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/marie-osmond-family-instagram-moments.jpg><p>“They’ll want to go miniature golfing or my little granddaughter wants to just color or they’ll make fake food in their kitchen and we’ll eat it,” the <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> alum exclusively shared with Closer in October 2019. “Whatever it is.”</p><p>“Three of them went to school this year,” she sweetly continued. “My 5-year-old one and the two 3 year olds went to kindergarten and just to see them start to love life and achieve … and they’re just so precious.
