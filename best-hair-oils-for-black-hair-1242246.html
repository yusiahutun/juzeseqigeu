You have to know the right ways to apply them and if it's done right, the best result is quite assured. Follow these steps:</p><li><strong>Warm it up:</strong> Warm oil penetrates better. A gentle heating before application can make all the difference in absorption.</li><li><strong>Root-to-tip application:</strong> Start by massaging the oil into your scalp to stimulate blood circulation and then work down to the tips.</li><li><strong>Leave it for some time:</strong> Leaving the oil on for at least 30 minutes allows it to seep into the hair shafts. However, for deeper nourishment, an overnight soak can be beneficial.</li><li><strong>Rinse the right way:</strong> Using a mild, sulfate-free shampoo ensures that your hair retains the benefits of the oil while getting rid of excess grease.</li><p>It is true that the ritual of oiling goes beyond mere application. It's about ensuring each strand gets its nourishing dose, setting the stage for hair that radiates health and beauty.</p><p><strong>Contributor:&nbsp;</strong>Celestine Gitau, <a href=#>Certified Trichologist</a></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Picking the right oil can make all the difference for your hair.
