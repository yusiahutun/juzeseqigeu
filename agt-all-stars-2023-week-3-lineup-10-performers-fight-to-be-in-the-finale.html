Note, only two of these ten contestants will proceed to the Finals - one via the Golden Buzzer and one via the votes of 'AGT' superfans, the results of which are disclosed at the end of the episode. As a result, the remaining eight artists will be eliminated from the competition. 'AGT: All Stars' 2023 Week 3 lineup has now been released. Keep reading to know who is coming in.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'AGT: All-Stars' fans rejoice as Aidan Bryant knocks out show rival Dustin Tavella to advance to finale</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'AGT: All-Stars' fans dub ballerina Vitoria Bueno as 'prancing girl', ask how she made it to 'top three'</a></p><h2 class=split>'AGT': All Stars 2023 Week 3 Lineup</h2><p>So, who will be on 'AGT: All-Stars' on January 16? All the scheduled artists have been confirmed by NBC. They are as follows:</p><h2 class=split>Avery Dixon</h2><p>Avery Dixon is a saxophonist who graduated from Boston's Berklee College of Music and gained national attention after he received a Golden Buzzer from the judges on 'AGT' Season 17. Avery was featured on television on May 31, 2022, making him famous as a professional saxophone. He released his debut studio album, 'One For The Red Bow Tie,' in December 2022. This album has various tunes, making it a comprehensive playlist worth playing over the Christmas season.</p><h2 class=split>Peter Antoniou</h2><p>When Wallingford-based psychic-comedian Peter Antoniou performed on NBC's 'AGT' for the first time in the summer of 2021, he'd only been in the US for six months after migrating over from his home England. That 'AGT' exposure — he reached the quarterfinals — led to more engagements, tour dates, and corporate jobs, including last month's Christmas party at his Los Angeles talent agency.</p><h2 class=split>Viviana Rossi</h2><p>Viviana Rossi is a Spanish gymnastics champion who has also been with Cirque du Soleil. Her Season 17 audition involved hanging from a bathtub full of water. Despite being voted through by the judges, she did not make it to the live performances that season. Viviana is back for 'All-Stars,' and this time she's traded water for fire.</p><h2 class=split>Dustin’s Dojo</h2><p>Dustin's Dojo was the first act to receive the Golden Buzzer on 'AGT' in Season 9. Friends Dustin and Terry advanced to the following round, but did not advance any farther. They did, however, continue their karate act for years after that.</p><h2 class=split>Mike E. Winfield</h2><p>This time, Mike's act contains gags about how much 'AGT' has affected his family's life, with a particular focus on his "step-man" (aka his stepson who is roughly the same age as him). For what it's worth, both the judges and the crowd seem to be enjoying what they're hearing. Mike is presently hosting 'America's Got Talent Presents SUPERSTARS Live' at the Luxor in Las Vegas.</p><h2 class=split>Keiichi Iwasaki</h2><p>Keiichi Iwasaki debuted on 'Britain's Got Talent' Season 15 and stunned the judges and the audience with his masterful performance. He did a chopstick feat where he pushed it into his mouth and nose and then pulled it out. He also appeared on 'Spain's Got Talent' in 2018 and made it to the grand finals. He did not, however, win and finished 10th. He also appeared on 'Bulgaria's Got Talent' in May 2021, reaching the finals. In December 2021, he competed in 'Germany's Got Talent,' reaching the finals and finishing seventh.</p><h2 class=split>Dance Town Family</h2><p>What began as a family dancing together has evolved into an institution that produces and teaches dancers and youngsters as young as three years old. Dancers from the Dance Town Family have been on shows such as Jennifer Lopez's 'World of Dance,' 'AGT,' and 'So You Think You Can Dance.' They've also been on Paula Abdul's 'Live to Dance,' as well as the Latin Grammys, Latin Billboard Awards, 'Strictly Come Dancing,' and the European edition of 'Dancing with the Stars.'</p><h2 class=split>Keren Montero</h2><p>Keren Montero Mendoza appeared in Season 2 of 'Dominicana's Got Talent' and went on to win the competition. During her tryouts, she played a gospel song called 'Rise Up,' and she captured the hearts of all the judges. She also got the coveted Golden Buzzer during her audition, advancing her to the next round.</p><h2 class=split>Captain Ruin</h2><p>Captain Ruin auditioned for 'Australia's Got Talent' Season 9 and received a Golden Buzzer. Unfortunately, he withdrew from the competition just before the grand finals. Ricki Lee, the show's host, offered no explanation for Captain Ruin's absence.</p><h2 class=split>Bir Khalsa</h2><p>Bir Khalsa Group stunned Australian viewers with their 'never-before-seen' act for 'Australia's Got Talent' 2022. This Sikh war art group, one of the most recognizable names in the world of martial arts, advanced to the semi-finals before being eliminated.</p><p>'America's Got Talent': All Stars episode 3 is scheduled to release on January 16, at 8 pm ET/PT on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRomZepeqK4y2aqrZmiqHpzfJFsZLCdlaB6dHnLoqWeraBifnF5z56pn6eiorKzv4yfoKCgpGLBsHnBnmSipl2ptaZ5xaKlmqSV</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hailey-bieber-crop-top.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hailey Bieber's Hot Crop Top Look Can Be Yours For Only $40</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./revolution-in-the-head-by-ian-macdonald-a-song-by-song-history-of-the-beatles.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Revolution in the Head by Ian MacDonald all together now | Books</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
