The community, along with the Muskogee Police, actively participated in the search, with the police seeking public assistance.</p><p>The tragic end to the search came on January 18, 2024, when Harms was found unresponsive in someone’s backyard near North 6th Street and West Martin Luther King Street. Muskogee Police are currently investigating the scene to unravel the circumstances surrounding her death.</p><p>The news of Amanda Harms’ passing deeply saddened Muskogee Public Schools, where she had been a respected educator for the past two years.

The district also announced the provision of additional counseling services for students and staff in need. As a measure to respect the family’s privacy, the district emphasized that this would be the only statement released regarding the matter.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=what-happened-to-amanda-harms><strong>What Happened To Amanda Harms</strong></h3><p>The unsettling question looms large in the community: Was Amanda Harms a victim of murder, or did she take her own life?
