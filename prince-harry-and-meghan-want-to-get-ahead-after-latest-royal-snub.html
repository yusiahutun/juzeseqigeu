The Duke has spoken about his estranged relationship with his father, and now it looks like he’s been ‘snubbed’ from his 75th birthday party.</strong></p><p>A representative for <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> recently ‘insisted’ that there had been no contact with his father, <a href=#>King Charles</a>, about an invitation to his birthday party, due to take place next week. Previous reports suggested they had ‘snubbed’ the invitation.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1243362200-666x1024.jpg><p>After claims that Prince Harry and <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> had ‘snubbed’ an invitation from Charles, a spokesperson for the pair put out a statement:</p><p>“There has been no contact regarding an invitation to His Majesty’s upcoming birthday. It is disappointing the Sunday Times has misreported this story,” their spokesperson told Mail Online.</p><p>“They had not received any invitation and were unaware of any celebrations until the stories came out,” a source told the outlet.</p><p>Speaking to GB News, royal expert Kara Kennedy&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> it was ‘interesting’ that the Sussexes put their name in front of the response.</p><p>“Usually when Harry and Meghan want to dispute something, it’s a ‘source close to the couple’, but you can tell with this statement, that they really want to get in front of the story, and show. the world King Charles has snubbed the pair for his birthday celebration.”</p><p>Although agreeing they should be there, Editor-in-Chief of Majesty Magazine, Ingrid Seward, said Harry’s presence “wouldn’t be very welcome amongst the rest of the family.”</p><p>Since leaving the <a href=#>royals</a>, the pair have not held back on voicing their opinions, particularly Harry in his memoir Spare.</p><p>The Duke didn’t hold back in writing about members of the family, including <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a>, which is said to have been ‘a <a href=#>big problem’ for Prince William</a>.</p><p>If it was a ‘biggish party’, the editor said she feels ‘in her heart of hearts’ that “Charles would invite his son, out of politeness. Knowing that he would probably refuse, and praying that he refuses.”</p><p>The panel then goes on to say that even if he hasn’t received an invite, he should still turn up. Although, Kara says they’ll “use it as an excuse”, and is going to be a ‘chapter in their next book’ or <a href=#>Netflix</a> doc.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-s-not-the-only-party-the-couple-have-been-snubbed-from-recently>It’s not the only party the couple have been ‘snubbed’ from recently</h2><p>Recently, it was reported that the Sussexes had also been ‘snubbed’ from <a href=#>George and Amal Clooney’s Gala</a>.</p><p>At the time, an insider <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Radar Online that the two were “humiliated” after not receiving an invite.</p><p>George and Amal were part of the couple’s <a href=#>celebrity</a> friends in <a href=#>Hollywood</a>, even attending their wedding. However, it now seems they weren’t as close as they once were.</p><p>Despite, this they attended King Charles’ Prince’s Trust event in London earlier this year. Maybe they’ll be getting an invite to his birthday…</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2WGcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaYp5xdorKotMCnZLCZnql6tbuMoJytZZGdsqKwjJqdrZ2iYrmiwMSsq2aqn66urXnSp6ybZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./priyanka-chopra-jonas-bedazzled-naked-dress-mumbai-event-7374015.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Priyanka Chopra Jonas's Bedazzled Naked Dress Had the Most Dramatic Cape</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./6629d808ca47413c568b45d2-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Palestino vs. Millonarios: hora y dnde ver por TV y online EN VIVO por Copa Libertadores 2024 - Fe</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
