Come the start of last year, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Forbes listed Paul 46th on their list of highest paid athletes</a>, estimating he had earned $38m from his fights in 2021.</p><p>However, Paul has actually claimed Forbes' estimations were wrong, <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>claiming his 2021 earnings were actually higher</a>.

Speaking to '<a href=# rel=nofollow>The Pivot</a>' podcast back in 2022, the 56-year-old claimed he used to do "crazy s***" with his money.</p><p>Tyson said: "When you're making that much money it lasts for a long time. That didn't die right away, it took like 15 or 16 years to go broke.</p><p>"I'm throwing s*** like 'hey baby, you like that car?
