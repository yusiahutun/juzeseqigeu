Video of them performing from their respective homes, as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that took their friend -- was interspersed with footage of Trousdale performing with the band and throughout his career.</p><p>As fun as it was seeing him singing with other costumed critters on the bonkers show, there was no denying the heart and passion he poured into this performance, and the obvious friendship he and his former bandmates still have.</p><p>That kinship and chemistry came through even from four different locations in a beautiful way. Grief can have a powerful effect in bringing people closer together, and no one understands what Trousdale's life was like during those year than these four men.</p><p>It was a powerful and stirring tribute to their bandmate and friend and a great way to honor what would have been his 35th birthday.</p><p><strong>Got a story or tip for us?
