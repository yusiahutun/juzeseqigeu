Joey’s Bachelor 2024 winner is Daisy Kent, a 25-year-old Account Executive from Becker, Minnesota, according to Reality Steve. His runner-up was Kelsey Anderson, a 25-year-old Junior Project Manager from Leesville, Louisiana.&nbsp;</p><p>Joey and Daisy are engaged and still together after The Bachelor Season 28, according to Reality Steve. Joey gave his final rose to Daisy at the Final Rose Ceremony in The Bachelor Season 28 finale in Tulum, Mexico, and proposed to her, which she accepted and they got engaged.</p><p>For Joey’s engagement, it’s almost certain the ring was designed by Neil Lane, a celebrity jeweler, who has created engagement rings for The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise since 2008. In a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a>, former host Chris Harrison revealed that Bachelor Nation couples have to stay together for a certain amount of time, otherwise they have to return the free engagement ring to Neil Lane. “There’s some rule, after a certain number of years, you get to keep it anyway,” he said. “But after months… it goes back.”</p><p>Lane told <a href=#>StyleCaster</a> in 2016 that he doesn’t know where the rings go, but that he designs them with the hope that the couple stays together. “I make rings hoping that people stay together forever, but after they get the ring, I don’t have a say in it, and what happens after that, I don’t know,” he said. “Where the ring goes, I have to say, I don’t really know. I just say it goes to ring heaven.”</p><p>So who is The Bachelor 2024 winner, Daisy Kent? Daisy is a 25-year-old Account Executive from Becker, Minnesota, who now lives in San Diego, California. Her Instagram handle is @<a href=# rel=nofollow>daisyykent</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Daisy listed her job on The Bachelor as an “Account Executive.” According to her <a href=# rel=nofollow>Linkedin</a>, Daisy works as an Account Executive at the finance company Jungo, where she’s worked at since September 2020. Daisy is also the founder of Hear Your Heart, a nonprofit organization created to help support children who have autoimmune disorders or hearing loss. “We help give children medical assistance, funds for future education, and bringing awareness to mental health for children and families. Hear Your Heart believes every child should live their life to their fullest. We are striving to encompass what it truly means to Hear Your Heart, challenging all to listen inward and explore all options,” Daisy’s Linkedin reads.&nbsp;</p><p>Daisy graduated from San Diego State University in 2021 with a degree in Communications with a specialty in Digital and Social Media. She also attended the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona in 2020, where she studied journalism, communication, and world relations.&nbsp;</p><p>In an <a href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram</a> post in April 2023, Daisy explained how she started losing her hearing when she was a child and received her cochlear implant. Being a little girl who couldn’t stop singing & playing piano I never imagined I would lose my hearing. Slowly losing conversations, music, part of who I am has been the most challenging thing I’ve experienced & has broke my heart in ways I didn’t think possible,” she captioned a photo of her cochlear implant. “A cochlear implant gives me the chance to love all of this again. It’s not an easy journey, but I’m learning it’s one that is changing my life every moment my brain takes in a new sound! I’m thankful to the people who have inspired me by showing that being different is beautiful & powerful. Forever grateful for my supportive surgeon, friends & family who continuously uplift me every step of the way. 😌 TO A WHOLE NEW ADVENTURE & finding the beauty in all the unexpected things.”&nbsp;</p><p>Read Daisy’s <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bachelor 2024 biography</a> and fun facts ahead:</p><p>“Daisy is SO ready to find the one.

She’s looking for a partner who is loyal, adventurous and family oriented, and will be there for her no matter what. The account executive’s childhood was like a storybook growing up on a Christmas tree farm, and now Daisy is hoping to find her fairy-tale ending.
