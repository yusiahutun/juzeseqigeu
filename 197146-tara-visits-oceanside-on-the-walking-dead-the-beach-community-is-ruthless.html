After an Oceanside outsider named Cindy saved her life and left her some water, Tara stumbled upon the group's encampment. It looked like something out of <i>Lost</i>, with leafy decor and a strict fish diet. They live in tents near the beach. The children carry weapons and are pretty gung ho about killing both walkers (which they call bobbers) and outsiders. They have cool names like Cathy, Beatrice, and Natanya. It's a pretty sophisticated community build on a vintage beach resort community.</p><p>Tara talks her way out of a swift execution at first, and ultimately learns that Negan and the Saviors executed all of the men in the community. They surviving women moved locations, and have been in hiding ever since. In the comics, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Michonne joined Oceanside</a> for a small amount of time. Tara ended up leaving to find Heath, but was betrayed by the Oceansiders a second time. She promised Cindy that she would never return or betray their location to Negan. The fact that they keep trying to kill her makes that super believable.</p><p>Will Tara break her promise and go back to Oceanside? Heath already warned her that her group was dangerous. And let's be honest, Alexandria was doing fine before Rick came along. I kind of hope that Tara does tell her friends about the community, if only to see this army of lady soldiers in action. Clearly, they have reason to join the fight. I'd also like to see more of Cindy. Could she be Tara's new love interest, provided that she's still alive? They already have a difference in ideologies that I think would be interesting to explore. "Nobody's evil," said Cindy, "they just decide to forget who they are." Tara, who originally followed The Governor, knows that that isn't necessarily the case.</p><p>Oceanside has the resources and the skills to really be an asset to the Alexandria Safe-Zone in the impending war against the Saviors. They are also excellent proof of Negan's reach and influence. While I understand why Tara would want to keep their secret, I don't think we've seen the last of Oceanside on <i>The Walking Dead</i>.</p><p><i>Image: Gene Page/AMC</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyhZZqa29lpJa%2FonnVoqqirKNivKSxwKeqopyVYryvedOhnGavkaG4qrrGZpuemZRiwamxjJucmpuYYrCwucyupaKsqWK2tHnRrquhpJWowA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chanel-west-coast-on-sexual-harassment-in-the-rap-world-its-hard-being-a-woman-in-this-industry-exclusive-video.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chanel West Coast on Sexual Harassment In the Rap World (Exclusive)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mistress-t.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mistress T - Age, Net Worth, Height, Bio, Career, Single, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
