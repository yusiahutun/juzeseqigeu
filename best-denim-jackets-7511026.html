One of the most timeless pieces to ever exist, the chance that you already have one in your closet is high. “A denim jacket is an item that has been in my wardrobe through my adolescence and in my adulthood," says designer Steph Mendoza. "From the looks of it, it’s not going anywhere.” And while they can be worn with almost anything or during any season, the number of styles out there can be hard to parse through when deciding what type of jacket you want.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Think cropped, oversized, hooded, colorful, embroidered — the list could go on and on.&nbsp;The dream denim jacket is one that molds to your body, offers a decent amount of warmth, and is versatile enough to dress up or down. We spoke to fashion experts and looked into our own closets to find the best jean jackets in inclusive sizes, high quality materials, and designs you'll never get sick of.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-levis-womens-original-trucker-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Levi's Women's Original Trucker Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Levi&amp;acirc;s Original Trucker Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OHmQ19QXj8D4L8WqcXVX7UQ3Wpc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/levis-original-trucker-jacket-3231ad47258947e9b9bcbf631bf46d00.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:&nbsp;</strong>You can't go wrong with this classic denim jacket.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:&nbsp;</strong>There's a limited amount of washes in the plus-sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“When you think denim, you think Levi’s,” says model Alexis Ren. “New or old, this jacket is a classic.” Almost every stylist&nbsp;InStyle&nbsp;spoke with mentioned their Levi’s jacket, whether it was thrifted or new, and there is no better place to start than with the original. Not only is the price great for the quality but also, since it only gets better with time, you can (and should) hold onto it forever. The straight silhouette hits at the hips for a classic fit and features the quality denim Levi’s is known for, making this one you absolutely need to add to your closet. You can pick from a whopping 10 different washes, but we just wish the plus-sizes had just as many washes to pick from.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:&nbsp;</strong>XS–4X |<strong>&nbsp;Washes:&nbsp;</strong>10<strong>&nbsp;</strong>|<strong> Fit:&nbsp;</strong>Standard</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-hm-short-denim-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>H&M Short Denim Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="H&amp;amp;M Short Denim Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sZvxx0RGKgRie_gWFF-1RPjKkYA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/HM-Short-Denim-Jacket-f795e108e7f948e1af5a9e8199f4c818.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>H&M</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It comes in all our favorite denim jacket colors.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s ever so slightly cropped, and may not offer the most warmth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s really nothing not to love about this jacket. It’s got all the key components of a stellar denim jacket: a vintage wash, a trucker design, and the ideal sleeve and hem lengths. It also comes in some of the most popular denim colors, including black, white, and gray. Thanks to its ever-so-slightly oversized fit, you’ll be able to layer some shirts and sweaters underneath without feeling stuffed. Without any frills or patterns, it’s almost like the blueprint for a classic denim jacket. And that for less than $50? Not a bad deal, if you ask us.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">H&M does call this a “short” jacket, cropping right at the hip. For everyday use, it’s ideal, but if you truly want to stay protected against cold or windy days, you may want to go with a long style, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Rails Mulholland Jacket</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XXL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Washes: </strong>4<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fit: </strong>Standard</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-sandro-paris-cropped-denim-coatigan></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sandro Paris Cropped Denim Coatigan</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Sandro Paris Cropped Denim Coatigan" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KNU4AK1NxF6lxC7JNPe-Vmv8tEo=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sandro-Paris-Cropped-Denim-Coatigan-f6160789236c4bf18adb2ed119b5718f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sandro Paris</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s a fun alternative to the standard denim jacket.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Cream is more difficult to keep clean.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Taking a bit of a turn from the standard denim jacket, this patterned option from Sandro Paris makes for a stylish statement. The cropped piece features the jean-detailings over the shoulders, on the collar, and on the cuffs, but the rest of the body has Sandro’s signature “S” printed across. The jacquard design feels freshly unique, and because it’s in a cream color, you can still match it with plenty of outfits without clashing. That being said, cream is also more difficult to keep clean. Luckily, you can machine wash it on delicate to get any stains out. Reminder that the hem is a bit cropped, so you may want to pair it with high-waisted bottoms and shirts that aren’t too long.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Washes: </strong>1<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fit: </strong>Cropped</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-universal-standard-kelsey-denim-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Universal Standard Kelsey Denim Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Universal Standard Kelsey Denim Jacket " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Qy1ncMXhWWUc9G0mjhkdWbIOPVs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/universal-standard-kelsey-denim-jacket-111dab34fe5b46498482035c1a61d59b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Universal Standard</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:&nbsp;</strong>The contrast stitching make the darker washes pop.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong>&nbsp;The brand uses its own sizing scale, so can be harder to navigate.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made with a bit of elastane (and mostly cotton), this denim jacket from Universal Standard is the perfect lightweight option with plenty of stretch for maximum comfort. Like all Universal Standard pieces, the sizing is unique to the brand — meaning that a 14-16 is a size small, instead of the traditional size four — so pay close attention to the size guide as you go to purchase. But we deeply appreciate how vast the options are, extending all the way to a 4XL. Featuring a tailored fit in stretch denim, it’s a jacket that feels good on and moves with you. Plus, it features some contrast stitching, which is a detail Agana loves.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:&nbsp;</strong>00–40 |<strong>&nbsp;Colors:</strong>&nbsp;4<strong>&nbsp;</strong>|&nbsp;<strong>Wash:&nbsp;</strong>Light and dark<strong>&nbsp;</strong>|&nbsp;<strong>Details:&nbsp;</strong>Tailored</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-petite-gap-90s-icon-denim-jacket-with-washwell></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Petite</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>GAP '90s Icon Denim Jacket with Washwell</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="GAP '90s Icon Denim Jacket with Washwell" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/etjSnmhOTA0dqR3mpB8h08qDtDI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gap-90s-icon-denim-jacket-with-washwell-3dd8a5be15f74e1eba1ba80153442f26.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>GAP</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:&nbsp;</strong>It comes in a petite sizing option for the best fit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:&nbsp;</strong>It has very limited sizes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The hardest thing about finding a denim jacket&nbsp;when you’re petite&nbsp;is the sleeve length. Thankfully, the denim jacket from Gap, another maven for denim, comes in petite sizing and will feature a better arm's length for those on the shorter side. The wash is a classic medium, and even though it’s made from rigid denim, it still has the perfect lightweight feel to it. Unfortunately, the size range is rather limited, however, making this less inclusive than we would like.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:&nbsp;</strong>XS–L |<strong>&nbsp;Washes:&nbsp;</strong>Medium<strong>&nbsp;</strong>|&nbsp;<strong>Fit:&nbsp;</strong>Regular</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-oversized-free-people-we-the-free-opal-swing-denim-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Oversized</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Free People We The Free Opal Swing Denim Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Free People We The Free Opal Swing Denim Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/gKuvWPCrKJr_YPW0WedudsbpioM=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Free-People-We-The-Free-Opal-Swing-Denim-Jacket-3acd42d5f7ae49d3a835840caa53af5f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Free People</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The vintage style is reminiscent of the '80s.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The wide opening around the hem will invite all the breeze.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Leave it to Free People to perfect the oversized denim jacket. The label, well known for its relaxed lifestyle and free-spirited fashion, crafted this old-school jacket reminiscent of the ‘80s. With dropped shoulders, generous sleeves, and a boxy body, the item checks off all that’s needed to be considered oversized. All the colors also offer a lower hemline in the back than in the front, which is a fun little touch to the look. Because of the wide opening at the bottom, however, any kind of breeze will seep right through.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Washes: </strong>9 |<strong> Fit: </strong>Oversized</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cropped-reformation-jori-cropped-denim-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cropped</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Jori Cropped Denim Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Jori Cropped Denim Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/c3pRfQ0gCfBmO3InpNxFU8ZySdM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Reformation-Jori-Cropped-Denim-Jacket-0f55b9f175d64ba6812ed1bb4bd74711.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Puffy sleeves bring the old school vibes to life.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You can’t throw it into the dryer without shrinking.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This jacket might be the closest style you’ll find to resemble your dad’s old jacket from the ‘80s, but cut with a feminine silhouette in mind. The jacket crops around your waist so you can pair it with another ‘80s dad jean. Large puffy shoulders and sleeves bring the old-school vibes to life, and a classic vintage wash further adds to the appeal. If you wanted it in a more modern style, however, you’ll find a few more current colors on the roster as well, like espresso and marzipan. Since it’s already cropped, you have to line dry it to ensure the recycled cotton doesn’t shrink any more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Washes: </strong>4<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fit: </strong>Cropped<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-ultra-cropped-sidefeel-western-cropped-denim-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Ultra-Cropped</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sidefeel Western Cropped Denim Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Sidefeel Western Cropped Denim Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3qj65PXGIarU-FbO6DPdkBqJRig=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sidefeel-Western-Cropped-Denim-Jacket-1cdb75eadabf4f908d75bb1be6c47e7a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The smooth surface adds a touch of elegance to an otherwise casual look.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There are no reviews yet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rather than a distressed vintage wash, this option offers a more sleek look. It comes in three classic denim colors, all of which have a smooth texture that’s a step up from the casual laid back appeal of a standard denim jacket. And while the hemline crops just below the belly, the sleeves are still long enough to cover your palms. With ample space in the boxy cut, you can layer some cropped shirts underneath for a cute fall outfit. Unfortunately, this item doesn’t have any reviews yet on Amazon. But the brand itself focuses on creating flattering denim pieces for women, all of which have impressive ratings, allowing us to feel confident in the quality and style of this item as well.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>S–XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Washes: </strong>3<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fit: </strong>Cropped</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-black-madewell-oversized-trucker-jean-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Black</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell Oversized Trucker Jean Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell Oversized Trucker Jean Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/gQ4KNmZ9h9OW4nwgtBU95KKxzew=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Madewell-Oversized-Trucker-Jean-Jacket-94dea1923e374b4c90e3a1c3236d0793.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It has a large size range.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s a bit rigid at first.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re quite big fans of Madewell and have voted their denim jackets as one of our editor favorites in the past. This black-washed piece is just as eternally stylish. It has a slightly oversized cut, but not an overwhelming amount — it’s just enough to comfortably fit your big cozy sweaters underneath. You’ll find pockets sewn into the interior of the jacket to keep your valuables safe and snug against you. The denim is a bit rigid, considering it’s 100 percent non-stretch cotton, so it may take some time to break in. Give it a few weeks, maybe a month or two, and it will feel like it has molded into your perfect fit.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XXL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Washes: </strong>1<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fit: </strong>Standard</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-white-7-for-all-mankind-classic-trucker-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best White</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>7 for All Mankind Classic Trucker Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="7 for All Mankind Classic Trucker Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/yrR6DIfDYm2I2dnOuJRmiq9AEKU=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/7-for-All-Mankind-Classic-Trucker-Jacket-9bc66f2753ed44bcb67fb16f415b9bde.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>7 for All Mankind</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It can be machine-washed.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It can’t be machine-dried.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those of you with a more monochrome closet, a white denim jacket will come in handy. This one has more of a fitted look, which matches the spiffy white hue. Thanks to the bit of elastane woven into the fabric, the jacket is also decently stretchy — at least enough to fit over long-sleeved tops. And yes, it may be tricky to keep an all-white piece such as this clean, but the good news is it can be machine-washed! Just make sure not to follow it up with the dryer, as it will shrink. Lay down flat to dry and it will keep its pristine condition.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Washes: </strong>1<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fit: </strong>Standard</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-anthropologie-closed-oversized-denim-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Anthropologie Closed Oversized Denim Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Anthropologie Closed Oversized Denim Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/l4IGIi6Wx74ZmB-6rGDDL2J5_Qc=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Anthropologie-Closed-Oversized-Denim-Jacket-1bcc53e4e3df4cafa35710ca13b71cbb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anthropologie</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You basically get two jackets in one here.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There aren’t many color or size options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We wouldn’t forgive ourselves if we didn’t include this long denim jacket. Sitting in between a coat and a jacket, this piece is as unique as your beautiful self (will flattery get me somewhere here?). It’s got an oversized cut with dropped shoulders that lead into wide sleeves. The hem reaches the thighs and has a very light distressing around them. Chic lapel collars frame the face, and two gigantic pockets are found on the front. Lastly, you’ll find two slits on each side of your hip for easy movement. Yes, she’s a little pricey, but you are basically getting a two-in-one piece, so in a sense you’re saving money? Although we do wish the color and size options were more abundant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL |<strong> Washes: </strong>1<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fit: </strong>Oversized</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sherpa-hollister-sherpa-lined-crop-denim-biker-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sherpa</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hollister Sherpa Lined Crop Denim Biker Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hollister Sherpa Lined Crop Denim Biker Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xrozsBIyuUDo9YnoM6FbKfOZ1b4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Hollister-Sherpa-Lined-Crop-Denim-Biker-Jacket-595693c079c74f3f8e501ca55245f24a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hollister</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You’ll stay cozy in the fully-sherpa lined interior.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s cropped, so you’ll need some high-waisted pants to stay properly covered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For when the temperatures drop even lower, this sherpa denim jacket comes in handy. Completely lined with faux fur, you’ll stay extra cozy snuggled up in the soft embrace of this jacket. You’ll find sherpa details in the collar, front pockets, and cuffs as well. The jacket is cropped and has a two-button closure, so you’ll definitely still need high-waisted pants and a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>turtleneck</a> if you want to stay completely warm.

More than just your standard denim jacket, this one has an undeniable style to it that sets it apart from the average. Gone are the collar and buttons that characterize most denim jackets. Instead, slouchy shoulders create a relaxed look, while a cinched-in waist adds a touch of sophistication back in. There are even zippers on the shoulders that you can open and play around with the look. While I love the cropped sleeves, it’s likely you won’t be able to wear any long-sleeved shirts underneath as they will show.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Washes: </strong>1<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fit: </strong>Standard</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-blue-cos-cropped-denim-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Blue</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cos Cropped Denim Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cos Cropped Denim Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lTViuqjmdO6gaTCZGaIShKSkaOg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Cos-Cropped-Denim-Jacket-984b57927a0348f181c572c7d96744f1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cos</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The fit, color, and style will remain relevant for years to come.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>This piece needs to be dry-cleaned as it may lose some color in the wash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you think of jean jackets, you most certainly think of a rich blue hue. The style was popularized in the '80s and continues to be an iconic color. We picked this COS option because it checked off all the style points we’re looking for: two large front pockets, a loose shape, a metallic button-down, and a vintage-inspired wash. The boxy fit makes it easy to throw over just about any outfit, and the slightly cropped hem keeps things from looking too slouchy. It’s a fantastically designed piece that will remain cool for years to come. When it’s time to give it a good wash, however, make sure to bring it to the dry cleaners as it may lose its color in the machine.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>2–14<strong> </strong>|<strong> Washes: </strong>1<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fit: </strong>Boxy</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-pink-rails-mulholland-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Pink</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rails Mulholland Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rails Mulholland Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0-6q_TmaAKeRlBF7JEM013l7ccE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Rails-Mulholland-Jacket-676c0c54271042fb951989f251ab250e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Rails</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They have a matching skirt.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Size up if you wish for a more oversized cut.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We know <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Barbiecore</a> may be coming to an end, but those die-hard pink fans will be pleased to know that this jacket is still offered in the rosy color (with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">matching skirt</a>!!). While the color may not be as evergreen as blue, the classic trucker style surely is. We’ve tried several denim jackets from Rails, and they’ve all become some of our favorites through the years. The dense stitching keeps any air from seeping through, making them reliably warm for the fall and spring. They can, however, feel a little fitted, making chunky sweaters impossible to wear underneath. If you wish for a more oversized cut, make sure to size up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–2XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Washes: </strong>9<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fit: </strong>Standard</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bomber-paige-denim-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bomber</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Paige Denim Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="b&amp;Atilde;&amp;para;hme Paige Denim Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_BdJxzfM1bZk90gBytGhGQkmG4E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Paige-Denim-Jacket-f92eec24613547ccbd39279f25eed017.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>bÃ¶hme</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It has a zip closure on the front if you're tired of buttons.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It only comes in one color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bomber jackets never fail to look cool, and because you love your black or cargo one so much already, why not get one in denim? This option from our favorite denim brand Paige features a ribbed neck, hem, and cuffs. You get both a zip and a button closure down the front — why that is, I’m not sure, but at least it’ll properly enclose you from the harsh winds. Two pockets are sewn on as well, letting you rest your hands and phone. And with an extra oversized fit, you’ll have absolutely no trouble fitting your cozy knit sweater underneath. Unfortunately, it only comes in one color.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL |<strong> Washes: </strong>1<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fit: </strong>Oversized</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fitted-helsa-denim-small-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fitted</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Helsa Denim Small Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="FWRD Helsa Denim Small Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0tmm3qW8pSquTOdf0XAX7jQ3ZJg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Helsa-Denim-Small-Jacket-8f6e643c3a604e50bcddfaa87b0eaf63.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>FWRD</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>While the bodice is fitted, long exaggerated sleeves keep the look interesting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The unique design may make it harder to style, especially with bulky tops.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those of you who haven’t heard, Helsa is kind of the cool new girl on the block. Founded by supermodel <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Elsa Hosk</a>, the brand merges edgy, classic, and current silhouettes to create designs that are simply drool-worthy. Take this fitted denim jacket, for example. It’s short and hugs the body, but the sleeves are extra long and somewhat loose. There’s contrast stitching on the dark denim, which adds yet another eye-catching detail. The stand-out piece will guarantee you individuality, sparing you from looking like everyone else on the street. Does that simultaneously make it harder to style? Possibly. But is it worth it? We definitely think so.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XL |<strong> Washes: </strong>1<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fit: </strong>Fitted</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-distressed-frame-le-vintage-jacket-raw-hem-in-rossum-rips></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Distressed</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Frame Le Vintage Jacket Raw Hem</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Frame Le Vintage Jacket Raw Hem in Rossum Rips" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5mHRu83mQgH5vDkqDfqrS7-T1H4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/frame-le-vintage-jacket-raw-hem-in-rossum-rips-6f4d4026f766468b917762e8c53df97b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Frame</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:&nbsp;</strong>The distressed hem makes this piece stand out from the bunch.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:&nbsp;</strong>The loose strands on the hem might pull and tear easily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Frame never fails to bring a high-end touch to relaxed pieces, and this denim jacket is a perfect example of it. At first glance, your eyes are immediately drawn to the distressed hem. While this detail sets this jacket apart from the rest, it should also be handled with a certain level of caution not to tear apart. The vintage-inspired, worn-in look awards you that effortless model-off-duty look, and when paired with a leather pants or white dress, you’ll feel the part too.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:&nbsp;</strong>XXS-XXL |<strong>&nbsp;Washes:</strong>&nbsp;1<strong>&nbsp;</strong>|&nbsp;<strong>Fit:&nbsp;</strong>Short</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hooded-levis-hybrid-original-trucker-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hooded</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Levi’s Hybrid Original Trucker Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Levi&amp;acirc;s Hybrid Original Trucker Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1eSvOD_iB7SGe66Z0WxofUMRyf8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/levis-hybrid-original-trucker-jacket-34598720dd4346d9957c50f360b0680e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Levis</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:&nbsp;</strong>The soft sleeves make this more comfortable than traditional denim jackets.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:&nbsp;</strong>The two offered colors come in different designs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hoodies make jackets a little more laid-back, and this option from Levi’s helps bring that appeal to life. But rather than an oversized jacket with a large hood, we wanted to highlight a form-fitting piece that can be worn with a little more versatility. The jersey sleeves make this slightly more comfortable than classic denim pieces as well.

Depending on preference, there are benefits for all different types of washes, but there are a few things to keep in mind when choosing between washes. Dark wash, or “raw denim,” is untreated and often stiffer, giving it a true workwear feel. Medium and light wash have been treated more, and in turn, give off a lighter color. Black denim is dyed to varying tones, meaning it’s liable to fade if over-laundered. Similar to black denim, resist the urge to over-wash your white denim as it will dull the color.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fit&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A fitted jacket versus an oversized one can be paired in different ways, and sometimes having both gives you more styling options.

It is all about playing around and seeing what styles you like best – and are the most comfortable.&nbsp;"I always buy denim jackets in their largest size," says Mendoza. "Wearing the sleeves pushed up always gives me an elevated silhouette.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Distressing</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While a raw hem can be popular, it may be less likely to hold up over time. When choosing between a distressed and hemmed option, consider the longevity of the piece. And remember, professional distressing is different than doing it yourself, so keep that in mind if you want a distressed piece to hold up over time, it might be worth investing in a pre-distressed jacket, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Frame's Raw Hem Jacket</a>, rather than distressing yourself.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you style a denim jacket?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There is no wrong way to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>style a denim jacket</a>, which is why it is beloved by so many people. “I love it styled with denim jeans and a button-down shirt, for a little denim suit moment," says NYC-based Stylist Shayna Arnold. "Also, I love the pairing of a denim jacket with a beautiful silk dress, for an interesting combination of structure and silhouette." Curve model Melonee Rembert's best styling advice: “Trial and error. Throw it over your look and see how it feels. Most times it’s the perfect layering piece.”&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How can you source a vintage one?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sometimes buying a denim jacket new is the best option, especially if you’re looking for a very specific style and wash, but because the quality of these pieces is normally made to last, it means there are abundant out there to thrift as well. Arnold said her favorite place to source any vintage denim is Stellas Dallas in Williamsburg. “They always have such a special variety, and it is very organized,” says Arnold. If you’re plus size, model Nika Gamble says, “I rarely see jackets that fit my arms in the women's section,” and suggests browsing through the men’s section instead.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What bottoms should you pair with a denim jacket?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the best things about a jean jacket is how versatile it is, both as a layering piece and as a piece to pair over specific bottoms. Agara prefers to balance out the volume of the bottoms to the volume of the jean jacket. “If it’s an oversized cropped jacket I would probably go with a bottom that has an equal amount of volume, so I would pair it with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>flowy or baggy trousers or even a pair of wide-leg jeans</a>,” says Agara.
