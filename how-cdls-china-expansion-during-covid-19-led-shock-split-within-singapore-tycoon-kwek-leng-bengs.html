Sincere had a development land bank of 9.2 million square metres (99 million square feet) in gross floor area across 64 development projects spanning 18 cities in mainland China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kwek shared his son’s vision and idea. “It was Sherman’s desire to get this platform so that we can extend in China,” he said. He was introduced to Sincere founder and leader Wu Xu, and came away impressed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/24/1ff6360b-fa9a-4aa9-939c-ea767b00782a_e1a62207.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He recalled: “Sherman and I met him and he brought us about Shanghai. We saw the way he operated, his best connections, his business acumen. We were impressed. Put it this way, I knew that what we would do with him would be very impressive.”</p>Like grandfather, like father, like son, the Kweks saw in Sincere a short cut to scale and success in <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">China property</span></a>. Similar to the CDL deal of 1969, the Copthorne acquisition in 1995 and the Regal buy of 1999, Sincere would be the latest in a string of bulk buys that would push Hong Leong Group and the Kweks into the next stratosphere.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Both Kwek Leng Beng and Sherman Kwek even used the same phrase repeatedly to describe these landmark purchases: “With a stroke of a pen, we could …”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In May 2019, CDL said it was taking a 24 per cent stake in Sincere for 5.5 billion yuan, or S$1.1 billion (US$820 million) then. It was CDL’s single largest investment in China to date.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sherman Kwek said at the media briefing: “This transforms our company especially in China, where it was very painful for us for the last seven to eight years to buy one project at a time … Now we can seriously bulk up on scale and grow with our partner with the necessary expertise on the ground.”</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/07/08/clean-thumb-min.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">10:57</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Boom, bust and borrow: Has China’s housing market tanked?</p><p>Boom, bust and borrow: Has China’s housing market tanked?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the same time, CDL announced that Sherman Kwek was appointed to the board as an executive director, joining his father and his uncle Kwek Leng Peck.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was going swimmingly for the young Kwek. “Being a Top 100 developer in China, Sincere would have been our key platform of growth there and I had plans to eventually rename it as CDL China,” he said.</p>“It would have turned us into a powerhouse in China, just like we are in <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Singapore</span></a>. I was buying a platform with a sizeable land bank and a big team, and not just a bunch of assets. This is similar to how our group took over CDL when it was still loss-making. Obviously, the key difference is that Sincere was carrying a heavy debt load and needed to be deleveraged and restructured.”<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China property crisis will need more than ‘simple policy’ solutions: experts</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As CDL conducted due diligence into Sincere, the Singaporeans discovered that the Chinese firm was in a worse financial state than they had expected. Like most developers in China, Sincere was heavily leveraged. Its net gearing was already at 200 per cent in May 2019, and as China walked into the Covid-19 crisis in early 2020, Sincere got more desperate. Its debt load was S$6 billion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Instead of being frightened off, Sherman Kwek saw an opportunity. He wanted to wrest control of Sincere at a better price than what was agreed in 2019. The 2019 deal was not completed as Sincere had not satisfied certain conditions. “I felt that we could save it and turn it around, then China would be one of our biggest markets,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He put forth a package for CDL to acquire 51.01 per cent, more than double the 2019 deal, at a cheaper price of 4.39 billion yuan. It also included a call option that CDL could exercise to buy an additional 9 per cent interest in the firm for 770 million yuan – the same valuation. Together, CDL would then hold a 60.01 per cent stake in the firm for a total of 5.16 billion yuan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/07/08/clean-thumb-min.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In early 2020, this proposal was put to the CDL board for approval. The cracks became evident during the meeting – about three hours long, shared Sherman Kwek – when various concerned directors debated the issue vigorously. In the eight-person board, with Sherman Kwek choosing to abstain because he had proposed the project, it came down to a narrow vote in favour of acquiring Sincere.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In April 2020, the announcement was made. In a statement to the Singapore Exchange, CDL made clear it was taking advantage of a distressed sale, saying: “Given the adverse impact of the Covid-19 crisis and the global uncertainty, CDL has taken the opportunity to negotiate new terms for its investment into Sincere Property, which are significantly improved over the terms announced last year.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sherman Kwek said it was a “game-changing investment” and that he was very optimistic about the tie-up between CDL and Sincere. “1+1 can be bigger than 2,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But analysts quickly wondered aloud if CDL was “throwing good money after bad” since the deal was delayed and Sincere’s steep valuation discount.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China’s property crisis also hitting Southeast Asia, regional body says</span></p></a></h3>Meanwhile, the pandemic had begun to ravage global economies, with CDL’s hospitality business severely impacted as borders closed and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">tourism</span></a> all but evaporated in a manner the world had not seen in generations. In Singapore, the government announced a “circuit breaker” to effectively send the entire country into a lockdown in the same month. Sherman Kwek had delivered his remarks via a virtual conference.To make matters worse, CDL was dealt an unforeseen blow by the Chinese authorities. In August 2020, China’s financial regulators introduced measures to rein in the highly-indebted developers – the likes of Sincere. In a move widely referred to as the “<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">three red lines</span></a>”, restrictions to cap borrowings by developers were further tightened, effectively making it near impossible for Sincere to turn around its fortunes unless there was a massive injection of funds.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By then, there was almost no chance of CDL putting in more money, director Philip Yeo said. “Without the three lines, we could have meandered through,” he said. “It reached the point when it was not possible to save Sincere.” The CDL board began to waver, with the thin majority about to give way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/24/43fc7ba7-1d26-4adb-8f65-b035475a90ae_0dec911c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Trouble was also brewing behind closed doors within the Kwek clan, whose Hong Leong Group holds a controlling stake in CDL. Several were not in favour of the Sincere deal and wanted to cut their losses, which amounted to S$1.8 billion including investments and loans made to Sincere.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Letters were sent to both Kwek Leng Beng and Sherman Kwek, demanding that the Sincere deal not go through. To force the issue, CDL director Kwek Leng Peck surprised his cousin and nephew by resigning from the board in October 2020.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While relations between them had been strained for months, neither executive chairman Kwek nor CEO Sherman Kwek expected him to quit a position he had held for more than three decades. “We didn’t know he was resigning and it came as a shock to everyone,” Sherman Kwek said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It did not help that Kwek Leng Peck put in writing that he was leaving because he did not agree with the board on the group’s investment in Sincere and its management of its hotel business. This was not a friendly exit. It was hostile.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As expected, it grabbed media attention immediately. The Business Times in Singapore called it “one of the most stunning” developments in CDL’s history. Bloomberg said it was “a rare moment of public discord” in the Kwek family, a dynasty which the Bloomberg Billionaires Index ranked as worth US$16.5 billion in 2020.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cecilia Kwek, the wife of Kwek Leng Beng and mother of Sherman Kwek, did not mince her words in her first public comments on the incident. “It hurt my husband, it hurt my elder son, it hurt me. It was a big letdown,” she said. “They did not hold our hands.”</p>Strictly Business: The Kwek Leng Beng Story, written by Singaporean author and journalist Peh Shing Huei, is available at major bookstores across Asia and online at <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">The Nutgraf Books</span></a>.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2mu8%2BlnGiZoqm2pLjEaGprbGJshHd7x6iuZpuUocBur8eipZplla29orrSoqanZZSqv6q6xmaaqK6ZmXpyhYylnJ1lo528pLeMrKeloaRixKrAx6KlZquZo7SivM6rnGasqZi8sLqMpK6eo12hsq%2BzjJucp5%2Bj</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./14-fonts-perfect-greeting-cards-posters.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 20 Best Fonts for Greeting Cards and Posters</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chinese-developer-sunshine-100-says-it-assessing-impact-liquidation-order-against-controlling.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chinese developer Sunshine 100 says it is assessing impact of liquidation order against controlling</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
