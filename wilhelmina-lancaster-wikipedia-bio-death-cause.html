At the Benedictines of Mary, Queen of Apostles, many people are praying over Sister’s body.</i></b></p><p>Wilhelmina Lancaster served as a nun. Her body was found in Gower, Missouri, still in its simple wooden box, even though she had not been preserved and had been buried in 2019.</p><p>This is according to the Benedictine order of nuns she started. Sister of the Most Holy Rosary, OSB,&nbsp;passed away on May 29, 2019. She was 95 years old.</p><p>Four years after she died and was put to rest in a simple wooden box, her body seemed&nbsp;in great shape.</p><p>The unusual condition of the remains of the contemplative order’s African American founder quickly spread through social media, bringing hundreds of visitors to the monastery in rural Missouri.</p><h2>Wilhelmina Lancaster Wikipedia Bio Age</h2><p>Sister Wilhelmina, born Mary Elizabeth Lancaster on April 13, 1924, desired to become a nun from a young age. She grew up in St. Louis, and when she was thirteen, she wrote a heartfelt letter about how eager she was to join the nuns and follow her calling as soon as possible.</p><p>Her determination and devotion led her to the Oblate Sisters of Providence, where she began her formation in 1941 and assumed the name “Wilhelmina” upon taking her vows.</p><p>This name was chosen in honor of Fr. William Markoe, S.J., her supportive pastor who had encouraged her to embrace her calling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-31-155139.png><p>Throughout her years with the Oblate Sisters of Providence, Sister taught in various schools across multiple Archdioceses, including Baltimore, Washington, Charleston, St. Louis, Philadelphia, and Miami.</p><p>Her love for teaching and caring for young minds helped her leave a lasting impression on many students.</p><p>In 2004, Sister Wilhelmina decided to separate from her community and made private vows until 2014 the Benedictines of Mary, Queen of Apostles, obtained formal recognition from the Vatican.</p><p><b>Also Read: </b><a href=#>Utah: Jordan Boone Missing Or Found?

Sister, a Catholic nun, was interred by hand on the convent grounds after her death on May 29, 2019, with the exact cause of her demise remaining undisclosed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-31-154856.png><p>The decision to exhume her body in April was made to adjust the construction of a St. Joseph shrine, as conveyed by a statement from the religious order responsible.</p><p>Since then, visitors from all corners of the country have flocked to witness this extraordinary sight, hoping to see and even touch Lancaster’s preserved body and garments.</p><p>A protective wax coating was applied to shield the nun’s remains before displaying her inside the chapel. Here, travelers have reverently touched her face and offered prayers. On Monday, her preserved body will find its final resting place in a glass case.</p><h2>Wilhelmina Lancaster Family</h2><p>Sister Wilhemina grew up in a Catholic family. She was the second of Oscar and Ella Lancaster’s five children.</p><p>In 1995, at 70, Sister made a courageous decision to establish the Benedictine Sisters of Mary, Queen of the Apostles, leaving behind the Oblate Sisters of Providence after over 50 years.</p><p>The Benedictine Sisters gained widespread recognition for their exceptional Gregorian chant and Catholic hymn albums. Sister became known for her unwavering devotion to the Traditional Latin Mass, Benedictine contemplation, and the Liturgy of the Hours.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-31-155102.png><p>She was a dedicated school teacher and archivist during her time with the Oblate Sisters of Providence.
