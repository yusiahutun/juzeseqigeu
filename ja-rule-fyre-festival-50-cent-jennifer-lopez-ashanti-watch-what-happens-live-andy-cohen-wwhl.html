Amber interpreted that for him to mean "he was surprised," at which point Ja finally agreed that he was "absolutely surprised."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c5c3ee70-03bd-5e54-9483-0ce238e6e8aa data-container-ref=toofab:article:cc842c63-3f73-50bd-a8fd-a44dad5b8c18 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e3/5by4/2019/07/10/e30962c1cc0b5a00b9bc64b0e15644e6_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Fyre Fest Breakout Star Andy King Set to Get His Own TV Show</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>He also backed away from his earlier claim that the issue with the festival was more one of false advertising than outright fraud. "I believe now," he said with nervous laughter. "After everything unraveled, it was a little bit of both."</p><p>And yet, Ja is determined not to give up on the notion of reviving Fyre Festival for a second shot. First, when Andy argued that no one would trust him, he countered that the disastrous event wasn't his fault. Second, "I have the biggest festival in the world, even though it never happened."</p><p>He's talking the power of brand recognition, and he is right. Everyone knows the name Fyre Festival, but the image it creates is that of people trapped on an island suffering. Andy wasn't buying it, either, saying, "I mean, it's like calling a ship the Titanic."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9dc5820e-c7a8-5a75-994c-c90265ba9934 data-container-ref=toofab:article:cc842c63-3f73-50bd-a8fd-a44dad5b8c18 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/37/5by4/2019/01/30/37aa7abe70a75f359f2810d9d26e6c48_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Netflix/Twitter</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">FYRE Fest Producer 'Blown Away' By Fame Over Oral Sex Revelation in Netflix Documentary</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>At one point, Ja actually had Andy convinced that he was going to preside over one of the biggest developments in pop culture history. "We've been having this ongoing feud now for like, I don't know, it seems like 15 years, something like that," Ja said of his ongoing beef with 50 Cent.</p><p>"I think it's time that we've grown past it," he said to an astonished Andy. "So I'm going to take the day on. Andy, and 'Watch What Happens Live,' this is what's happening live. I am removing myself from the circus, okay."</p><p>Andy was excited about this, but Ja wasn't finished with his thought.

Yeah, even trying to step away, Ja couldn't resist throwing one more jab. And then when Andy challenged him to say three nice things about 50, well things went downhill even worse.</p><p>"He's a bad father," Ja kicked off, before going on to insult his head and even his breath.</p><p>"I actually thought this was going to be something positive," Andy said, to which Ja reiterated that they were "sworn enemies forever!"</p><p>Then, out of nowhere, he said he was joking and again said he was removing himself from the whole feud now.

The scuttlebutt is that Ashanti was the actual vocalist for <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a></strong> at the beginning of her career, and particularly with her Ja Rule collaboration "I'm Real," which he wrote for her.</p><p>Right up front, Ja said as plain as day, "No, that's not true." Then he promised to clear the story up and did no such thing.</p><p>"I sung the original version of it as a reference, but I sounded terrible of course on the reference, so Ashanti then sung the reference for Jennifer Lopez," Ja said, explaining that when the record was mixed down, some of Ashanti's vocals were "underneath" J.Lo's..

"I don't f--king mix it!"</p><p>So instead, he said that what he does know is that this story is the initial rumor that became the rumor that J.Lo didn't sing on the track at all. So while "it's J.Lo on the record," that doesn't mean there might not be some Ashanti lingering underneath her vocals.</p><p>Clear as mud? Amber certainly thought so. "So J.Lo is nothing but Ashanti in a wig," she said directly into the camera. "You heard it here first."</p><p>"No, don't do that!" Ja shouted.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
