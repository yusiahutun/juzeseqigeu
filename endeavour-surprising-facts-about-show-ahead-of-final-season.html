And this is is an amazing job in many, many ways. But there is also a danger that you become lazy with your work so I always try to push myself. You have to engage with it," he said, adding that he's "dying to do it again".&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aa6f24f995b9-shaun-evans-2012-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ewjTX94VKU7i data-wc=8><strong>Shaun first appeared in the show in 2012</strong></p><h2>The show's creator made several cameos&nbsp;</h2><p id=eIGxTkIT3kTi data-wc=35>Colin Dexter, the author of the Inspector Morse novels that inspired the series, <strong>made numerous blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance in </strong>before his death just as he did with the original series and spin-off .&nbsp;</p><p id=eSMwBJo28XI1 data-wc=35>Due to his declining health, he didn't manage to make it on set for series four but can still be spotted in every episode, creatively placed in photographs in the background or in newspaper clippings.&nbsp;</p><h2>Fans can take part in an Endeavour walking tour in Oxford</h2><p id=eP2MPbHezqHO data-wc=38>As well as its brilliant characters and well-crafted whodunnits, the ITV drama is loved by viewers for its scenic backdrop.

"That was made clear from the word go." It is expected that Colin's&nbsp;wishes will be enforced by his estate for as long as they retain the rights – 70 years after his death.
