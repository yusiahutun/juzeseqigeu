The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> hotshot, who married Nikki Reed in 2015, shared how his life away from the glitz and glamour is helping him make a difference.</p><p>“I&nbsp;stepped away from acting&nbsp;a little over four years ago,” Ian said. “To&nbsp;raise my kids, build my companies and get these films launched.”</p><p>“Walking through the farm with kids and dogs and family,”&nbsp;the actor <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a>, “every stop, you’re pulling off of trees or off of bushes, pulling up out of the ground and feeding everyone as you’re moving through the farm.”&nbsp;</p><p>The peace and serenity come at a cost of tremendous effort but, in the end, it is worth the toil as the 45-year-old notes: “It’s&nbsp;unbelievable when you see these amazing creature life forms and how they all live on the farm together is really special.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1197944030-1024x772.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-we-secured-our-future>“We secured our future”</h2><p>After stepping away from acting, Ian has been actively working on multiple projects including their vision for soil management and how to combat climate change to build a “secure future today, or tomorrow.”</p><p>The Louisana Native was part of the documentary Common Ground; a film that highlights the flaws of the American farming system and the impossible struggles that farmers are facing.</p><p>According to its bio: “The film profiles a hopeful and uplifting movement of white, black, and indigenous farmers who are using alternative “regenerative” models of agriculture that could balance the climate, save our health, and stabilize America’s economy – before it’s too late.”</p><p>Speaking of his initiative for soil management, the <a href=#>celebrity</a> said: “By using healthy soil management practices, we are building a secure future today, or tomorrow.</p><p>“And once you do have children, you realize I am no longer alone here. I am leaving this to my children.”</p><p>Along with his efforts to restore the environment, Ian launched his pet food brand&nbsp;Nutro. The brand comes with the initiative Greater Ground, which was established to increase awareness around healthy soil practices.</p><p>With two children (a daughter and a son), and pets, Ian is content in his ‘dad life’ with <a href=#>movie</a> star Nikki who has followed her husband’s footsteps and moved away from acting since becoming a parent.</p><p>“It’s the best thing ever,” Ian gushed. “Once&nbsp;you become a parent, you realize everything you do throughout your day, you have the ability to make these little tiny incremental changes, whether it’s who you buy your cat and dog food from, what restaurants you eat in, how you dispose of your own waste.”</p><p>The Vampire Diaries star is proud of the difference that he can make: “Because it’s&nbsp;a pretty big, pretty crazy world out there. So the tiny things that you can do throughout your day, that make you feel great, are making a difference.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2WFcMDHnmSvmZ2ltrOxjJ2gmqqZmsBuv9OaqWacmamwqbHDZp%2BopJyuxLC7w2adqKpdnLywsIyapZ1lnqTEbrjIr5ysZaeewal5kHFkqZ2kqHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./article-45b76c72-4765-11ee-be81-13e32b392099-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wanda Denise Rogers | Death Notices</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pressed-flower-art.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How To Make a Pressed Flower Art Business</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
