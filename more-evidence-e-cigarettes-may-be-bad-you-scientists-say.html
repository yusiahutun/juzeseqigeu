The researchers created an extract from the vapour of two popular brands of e-cigarettes and used it to treat human cells in Petri dishes. Compared with untreated cells, the treated cells were more likely to show DNA damage and die. The e-cigarette with nicotine caused worse damage, but even the nicotine-free vapour was enough to alter cells. The dosage of vapour in the study was similar to someone smoking continuously for hours on end.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">SEE ALSO: Flavouring chemical in e-cigarettes linked to severe respiratory disease</span></a></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2015/12/31/0198a64a-aec6-11e5-86ff-b7a34a11666b_486x.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Promising results in treating decline in muscle mass and power in elderly</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An international research team has found promising results in a proof-of-concept trial for a myostatin antibody in treating the decline in muscle mass and power associated with ageing. Myostatin is a protein produced within the body that inhibits muscle growth. In the study, injections of a myostatin antibody over a 24-week period resulted in an increase in lean (muscle) mass and improved performance in tasks requiring muscle power in patients older than 75 with low muscle strength, low muscle performance and a history of falling. Tasks included climbing stairs, walking briskly and rising repetitively from a chair. “This is the first study to show that myostatin antibody treatment improves performance in activities requiring muscle power,” says researcher Stuart Warden, an associate professor in the school of health and rehabilitation sciences at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis in the United States.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2015/12/31/03143264-aec6-11e5-86ff-b7a34a11666b_486x.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Careful how you discuss weight with your daughters</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">How should a concerned mother discuss issues of diet and weight with her daughter? Very carefully, according to Erin Hillard, a doctoral student in developmental psychology at the University of Notre Dame in the United States. In an article recently published in the journal Body Image, Hillard and her colleagues reported on results from their study of a representative group of 11- to 14-year-old girls and their mothers. “Generally, we found that for the daughters who were being encouraged to lose weight by their mothers, outcomes were worse if their mothers were not also discussing their own weight concerns,” says Hillard. “The daughters who were being encouraged to lose weight but whose mothers were not also discussing their own weight concerns were more at risk for development of disordered eating, based on the higher scores on measures of dieting behaviour and drive for thinness they reported in eighth grade.” The best outcomes were found for daughters whose mothers were not engaging in either type of conversation, Hillard says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2aalZbCtcWOmqmtoZOhsnB9l3JtcGxjZLqwvsRmnK%2BhlJq7pLGMnmScoZeWv6bA056qZqWRrnqjsYybmJ1lqaTCbr%2FCopynrJmowbR50pqw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./about-the-whoop-4.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>WHOOP 4.0: Your Questions Answered</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lauri-peterson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lauri Peterson - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
