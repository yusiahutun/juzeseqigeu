After collaborating with the bestselling author on The Stranger&nbsp;and Stay Closer, Richard is teaming up with his good friend and master storyteller, Harlan, for a third time running – and <a class=hm-link href=#>Michelle Keegan's</a> signed on too.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Fool Me Once – trailer</figure><p id=et4Z0DM4yGF data-wc=22>"It's such a brilliant story. It's about a character called Maya Stern played by the brilliant Michelle Keegan," Richard, 49, tells <strong>HELLO!</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p id=eYmNM_Ulnj1 data-wc=64>"She sees something unthinkable on her nanny cam, which is her four-year-old daughter playing with her husband in the playroom. But, he was brutally murdered three weeks before, so he can't possibly be in that image. She then has to go on a journey to find out what really happened. It's just a brilliant suspenseful thriller and that's out on 1 January next year."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e3539ab7d50f-fmo101unit00725rt.jpg><p id=euxb5_KU3ej data-wc=25>Cast as Maya's husband, Joe Stern; throughout production, Richard worked closely with Michelle, but it was <a class=hm-link href=#>Julia Roberts</a>, who'd set her sights on the role.</p><p id=eGnK_n79YTP data-wc=43>"It was amazing. You know, I've always loved working with people who have come up through the ranks," explained Richard. "With Michelle, she came through soap operas because she was in Coronation Street for quite a long time. She's such a hard worker.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eXsApKU3wda data-wc=49>"She was such a trooper, you know. That part was actually optioned for a film with Julia Roberts, and Michelle Keegan finally got the role. She's such a hard worker, such a good-natured person, and really fun to work with. And I hope it does really well for her."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/7bb34a107f68-michelle-keegan-joanna-lumley-fool-me-once.jpg><p id=ev3_Rxe7PNO data-wc=63>As for why he's so fascinated by Harlan Coben's stories, Richard recalled: "I finished The Stranger and immediately wanted to do a second season, but Netflix has commissioned them [Harlan's novels] as stand-alone stories. But what happened – by accident – is that I've been able to do a second and third season within a Harlan Coben cinematic universe by playing different characters.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/18b367b17a55-richard-armitage-harlan-coben.jpg><p id=ek8D25g0wUW data-wc=37>"I just love him as a crime writer. I think he's a page-turning author and you get hooked on his Netflix shows. You can't stop watching them. You have to watch all eight episodes in one sitting."&nbsp;</p><p id=et821lfNq54 data-wc=63>An acclaimed author himself, Richard's debut thriller novel, Geneva, has also been optioned for TV – although for now the actor is keeping his cards close to his chest. "I'm definitely gonna be in it if we get it made soon enough otherwise, I'll be too old," he revealed. "But yeah, it's very early days. We're just looking for writers at the moment."&nbsp;</p><p id=eqhQY7pIv1 data-wc=17><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Richard Armitage is set to star in new ITV thriller - and it sounds seriously good</a></p><p id=e03-AImuD4 data-wc=12><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Obsession star Richard Armitage talks sexuality and coming out as teenager</a></p><p id=e44nhGjdNO7 data-wc=54>In the meantime, Richard is feeling festive with the release of his latest Audible collab.

"I mean, I think it's up there in my top five favourite books of all time. I did a production of it in drama school and I did a solo recording for audible of the book.
