But when a third person joined the Traitors in the turret, it was host Alan Cumming. Peter had declined their offer.</p><p>He certainly chose the harder path in the game, but you have to respect the integrity with which he's trying to navigate. He didn't want to betray his alliance -- which Sandra dubs The Peter Pals -- of Trishelle, John, Bergie, and Kevin, and he is feeling confident that he's on the right track.</p><p>He is with Parvati next in his line of sight, but it kind of breaks down after that. Trishelle, within his group, has proven the most savvy strategist as she rightly suspected Dan was trying to serve up an actual Traitor last week. No one else suspects Phaedra.</p><p>You never know how much is real in this heavily-edited show, but we did notice Parvati mean-mugging everyone. No on has a killer "Black Widow" look like Parvati, but was she actually giving off that vibe as much as it looked. Seemed suspicious to us.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f5b40775-1d14-4bbd-8f7c-a6bb4b346a72 data-container-ref=toofab:article:803537ce-30d2-40a8-b92d-d5c751e34d7e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/dc/5by4/2023/11/04/dc46d686b0084fe1b084e3edd07400f3_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">TooFab.com</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Reza, GG and MJ from Shahs of Sunset Give Updates on New Projects Post-Show Cancelation (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Well, it turns out she was as that's exactly what Phaedra finally told her at the end of the night. She was making people suspicious with her "ice princess" demeanor. Phaedra told her she needs to be more cheery, though Parvati said that's hard to do when everyone's gunning for her.</p><p>She certainly was giving Peter a look at breakfast when he didn't reveal that the Traitors had attempted to recruit him. He was hoping to save that bit of intel to use later, while Parvati is ready to use the fact he kept quiet against him.</p><p>Right now, the game is a battle between Peter and Parvati. It was Peter v Dan, with The Bachelor somehow defeating the Big Brother winner. Can he take out a Survivor winner next? Both Parvati and Dan made fateful errors, with Dan taking a missed shot at Bergie and Parv taking a missed shot to recruit Peter.</p><h3 class=h3>Oh Yeah, a Competition</h3><p>The most inconsequential part of the game for viewers, these games are everything for the contestants as that's how they bank money toward the prize pot at the end. For this week's competition, they had to carry bags through the woods and answer questions to determine their path.</p><p>One by one, wrong answers left players trapped in tar pits and rope nets until only two groups were left -- Parvati & John and Kevin & Sandra. This was coincidence, too, as when one member of a pair was trapped, the other was allowed to keep competing.</p><p>It was also bad news for the pot as each pair had one bag shared between them. With these two duos making it to the finish line, they only scored eight out of a possible $25,000 to add to their prize pool. In the end, Kevin & Sandra won Shields ... which would prove even more meaningful later.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f60a7ad8-4234-4129-abe2-44d3b38289c6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:803537ce-30d2-40a8-b92d-d5c751e34d7e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6f/5by4/2023/11/06/6f526d1d1fd241e09937e3334ec8b5c7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty/Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Every Bravolebrity Who Wanted a Piece of Below Deck's Captain Jason Chambers at BravoCon (Exclusive Details)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h3 class=h3>Round Table Twist (aka Later)</h3><p>Later turned out to be that very night as Alan came to pick up the players and take them back to the woods in lieu of a Round Table. That's right, there was to be no discussion and no Banishment. But, the Murder would still happen.</p><p>Instead of arguing over who they thought were Traitors, the players were tasked with choose a whopping five more people to get Shields and safety for the night. And for winning earlier, Sandra and Kevin got to choose the first one.</p><p>This was a big opportunity that Kevin, in his graciousness, threw away. With five more shields to give out, he could have kept the entirety of The Peter Pals safe. After all, the person they chose for safety would have chosen the next one.</p><p>What he doesn't know is that the other seven players in the castle had convened when The Peter Pals kept kicking everyone out of their private meetings and decided that perhaps Peter was a Traitor and the alliance was his shield. It's certainly suspicious he's excluding obvious Faithfuls from his meetings.</p><p>Sandra was leading that crusade at the pool table, detailing the numbers to the rest of the players, so she pushed to get first choice for safety. Kevin relented, and she offered it to Shereé, who in turn saved Phaedra (who got teary due to their long history), who saved CT, who saved John, who saved ... Peter.</p><p>That left Trishelle (who was upset her longtime Challenge pal didn't save her), Kate, Bergie, MJ, and Parvati without protection -- which reduces the number of potential targets down to four.</p><p>That night, Parvati and Phaedra weighed their odds, upset they couldn't murder Peter. Every day he's in the game is bad news for Parvati as he's gunning harder for her than anyone. But if they can't take him out, can they weaken him?</p><p>Both Bergie and Trishelle are available to kill. Bergie is loyal to a fault to Peter, which is detrimental. What they don't know, though, is that Phaedra is on Trishelle's radar as a Traitor, too, making her their actual biggest threat. So who did they Murder?</p><p>We won't find out until next week, making this an odd outing with zero players leaving the game. More time, though, is perhaps bad news for Peter as that gives Parvati more time to plot and scheme against him. We're keeping a close eye on her. She's not as subtle as her fellow "Black Widow Brigade" member Cirie, who won this game last season, but she's deadly in her own right.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b846332d-ebb1-4b9f-be8f-9a84ed2b2893 data-container-ref=toofab:article:803537ce-30d2-40a8-b92d-d5c751e34d7e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/93/5by4/2024/02/07/9357ec9a2ad241f092ed066a4c5cc6f0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Ariana Madix Hits Back After Tom Schwartz Says 'You're Not the Queen of the Group'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h3 class=h3>Castle Chatter</h3><ul><li>"Peter refused your attempt at seduction." --Alan (to Parvati and Phaedra)</li><li>"I'm a faithful to the end.
