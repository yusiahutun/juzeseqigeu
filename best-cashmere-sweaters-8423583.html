We’ve broken down those details for you ahead, while also shedding light on the cashmere sweaters that are most in style in 2024.

It’s lightweight with subtle ribbing at the trim and has a sleek and sophisticated fitted cut. You can hand wash it at home and lay it flat to dry, and we love that the brand offers styling advice on the product page for inspiration purposes. You can sift through street style images by gender and height to get a better sense of how the sweater looks on buyers all over the world.

It happens to be Sturino’s favorite. “It’s a super comfortable wool-cashmere material and pairs well with everything in your closet,” she tells InStyle. If you prefer a loose, boxy fit, the Marin is for you — and it comes in 10 two-tone colorway combinations, which cements itself as our favorite option on this list with stripes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–3X | <strong>Material: </strong>Cashmere, wool | <strong>Cut: </strong>Oversized crewneck</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lightweight-neiman-marcus-cashmere-superfine-crewneck-top></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lightweight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Neiman Marcus Cashmere Superfine Crewneck Top</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Neiman Marcus Cashmere Superfine Crewneck Top" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PA11AqNgFr0XSwpnTNXABjxVUIk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/neiman-marcus-cashmere-superfine-crewneck-top-eab039977422420fb7e03730cfa8b55b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Neiman Marcus</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s a super-soft, ultra-fine layering piece that still feels well-made.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Buyers say it runs small, and it’s only offered in muted tones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Neiman Marcus is known for its luxurious cashmere collection, which runs the gamut from cardigans and shawls to special feather- and sequin-adorned styles. If you’re looking for a super-lightweight and luxe, whisper-thin foundational layer, this top is a great option. Available in black, Cafe, Londen, Winter White, and Pearl Grey, you won’t find a piece in your wardrobe that doesn’t mesh well with this long-sleeved top.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL | <strong>Material: </strong>16gg, 2 ply cashmere | <strong>Cut: </strong>Crewneck</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-turtleneck-theory-crop-cashmere-turtleneck-sweater></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Turtleneck</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Theory Turtleneck Sweater</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Theory Crop Cashmere Turtleneck Sweater" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qtQnz5-hWc5shx-6ZCxxZ9TxiYE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/theory-crop-cashmere-turtleneck-sweater-d464b788c5bb451792d3ebaaafabf3fb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s perfect for wearing with high-waisted pants and skirts.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Sizing is limited, and there are only three colors available.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Known for its top-notch craftsmanship, Theory is a comfortable basics brand perfect for the minimalist wardrobe.

The signature stitching on this sweater adds dimension and interest to any outfit, whether you shop it in sand or gray. The mid-weight knit also makes it a great in-between piece for wearing over a thin dress in the summer or with a thick trouser and coat in cold weather. Spun in Italy, the Ophelia is an undeniably classic top to splurge on at any time of the year. The Row is one of stylist Evans’s favorite cashmere brands.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL | <strong>Material: </strong>Wool, cashmere | <strong>Cut: </strong>Crewneck</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cardigan-reformation-clara-cashmere-crew-cardigan></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cardigan</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Clara Cashmere Crew Cardigan</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Clara Cashmere Crew Cardigan" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/cyWzhlCuBTTLpGkwS1mwGEk_bv4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/reformation-clara-cashmere-crew-cardigan-eb54f78bb0424147922ce4769a65e90e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s made from full cashmere, with 90 percent of the material being recycled.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It isn’t offered in extended sizing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Reformation offers two takes on its Clara silhouette —&nbsp;one in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">alpaca</a> and the other in cashmere. Of course, we love that the company is upfront about its production process, confirming that the cashmere cardigan is made from regeneratively grown cotton, recycled cashmere, and traceable wool. While we wish it came with a tank to complete the set for the high price of $198, its color options are well-rounded, save for the absence of white.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL | <strong>Material: </strong>Recycled cashmere and cashmere | <strong>Cut: </strong>Relaxed crew</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shawl-vince-cashmere-shawl-collar-open-front-cardigan></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shawl</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vince Cashmere Shawl Collar Open Front Cardigan</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vince Cashmere Shawl Collar Open Front Cardigan" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jxT4hdzQxdi1TZofrHVK0fBCoGs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vince-cashmere-shawl-collar-open-front-cardigan-6168bbfa505c423d81c0a2d6fa39f2b7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vince&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It feels just as luxurious as it looks, with the material being entirely cashmere.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The length may be overwhelming on petite frames.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Vince’s cashmere shawl sweater is extremely luxe — the type of thing you want to lounge around the house in all day and dread taking off to roll into bed. Wear it with everything from satin palazzo pants to a cottagecore house dress and slippers. It bodes well with a warm cup of coffee or tea in your hands, too. The length may be overwhelming on petite frames, but it could be belted and worn with heeled boots for better proportions. The only thing that’s missing from the design?

We don't love the maintenance it requires as a dry clean-only piece, but most buyers confirm that it’s a great value for the price tag (under $200).

The brand even breaks down how the production of the sweater is bettering the environment in the onsite description. The colors it’s offered in right now are decidedly autumnal tones, and the overall rating from customers is positive — which is great for a cashmere sweater that rings in under $200.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XXXL | <strong>Material: </strong>Cashmere, recycled cashmere | <strong>Cut: </strong>Slim fit crewneck</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-v-neck-pure-collection-cashmere-v-neck-sweater></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best V-Neck</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pure Collection Cashmere V-Neck Sweater</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pure Collection Cashmere V-Neck Sweater" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/AWH3mltjYvigAkx9aGHFYsEDwM0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pure-collection-cashmere-v-neck-sweater-f9d1fb3991e04dbf9209932c621ca9c2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Pure Collection&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The V-neck doesn’t plunge too deep, making it unwearable without a peek of a bra or boob tape.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It starts at size 4, so petite women may not be able to wear it as fitted as it’s meant to be worn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This best seller at Pure Collection is made from 100 percent cashmere, a great layering piece as it’s lightweight, and offered in 13 colors. Buyers flag the shade, as some received hues that didn’t look quite as bright as the picture, and some left mixed reviews on sizing, so this pick may require some trial and error before settling on a selection.

Here, you’ll learn why the texture of Grade A, Mongolian-sourced cashmere feels warmer and more luxurious than other types. It’s the finest quality and most wearable, and this is because the harsh winter conditions in Mongolia cause cashmere goats to produce denser hair that is rare. If Lyndley wants to ensure a great feel before purchasing a new sweater, she checks where it was made and the blend. “Is it 100 percent cashmere, or is it a blend of cashmere, and what is it blended with?” she asks herself. Then, she researches once she has her questions answered.</li></ul><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Pilling: </strong>It’s crucial to remember that all cashmere will eventually pill, no matter the price. However, the higher the quality, the slower the pilling. To prolong the life of your sweater without pilling, use sweater spray and only wash occasionally. Both Evans and Lyndley also recommend cashmere combs, with Evans suggesting <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">N. Peal’s version</a> for $9, and Lyndley sourcing hers from <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Amazon</a> for $12. (She combs her sweaters whenever they pill, roughly once or twice a season as needed.) Meanwhile, Sturino consistently uses an under-$20 <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Conair fabric shaver</a> that she swears by to remove pilling.</li></ul><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Care: </strong>Overall, many sites recommend wearing your sweater five to seven times in between washes and airing it out after each wear. Invest in a cashmere comb and do this regularly after washes. Lyndley usually dry cleans her sweaters at the end of the season and leaves them hanging in the dry cleaner bag until the following season. Avoid machines at all costs, as cashmere fabric becomes fragile when wet. Air drying, meanwhile, allows the piece to maintain its shape and durability. Also, refrain from fabric softeners, as many of these have harsh ingredients and cashmere grows softer with time naturally, so they aren’t necessary. Another way to care for your cashmere according to Lyndley? Wear a T-shirt as a foundational layer so that you can prolong wear before washing.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the best way to store cashmere sweaters?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you prefer to clean and care for your cashmere on your own, and you don’t already have your sweaters in a dry cleaner bag to await the following season (or perhaps you wear them more frequently than that), fold your sweaters so the hangers do not damage the shoulders.

Bean, Reformation, Lauren by Ralph Lauren, La Ligne, and Naadam are recommendations for lower-end picks, while The Row, Khaite, Raey, Toteme, Bruno Cucinelli, Tom Ford, Loro Piana, and Gabriela Hearst can be thought of as splurge-worthy.
