For a wealth of fans out there, the idea of <a href=#>Chris Hemsworth</a> retiring is more than enough to break out the violins and erupt into tears. The 40-year-old best known for the role of Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe continues to be a much-respected presence in <a href=#>Hollywood</a>, but just to get the record straight, he’s not quitting the game and never announced he was.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/05/GettyImages-2150900597-1024x712.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chris-hemsworth-was-angry-over-false-reports-he-was-quitting-acting>Chris Hemsworth was angry over false reports he was quitting acting</h2><p>When working on a documentary series called Limitless for National Geographic in 2022, it was unearthed that Chris carried two copies of the APOE4 gene. In short, the gene typically suggests he’s at risk of Alzheimer’s.</p><p>When this was revealed, however, there were some inaccurate reports that he was retiring from acting.</p><p>Speaking with Vanity Fair recently, he’s set the record straight about how unhappy he is about that.</p><p>“It really kind of p****d me off because it felt like I had been vulnerable with something personal and shared this”, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recalled</a>. “No matter how much I said: ‘This is not a death sentence,’ the story became that I have dementia and I’m reconsidering life and retiring and so on.”</p><p>Sharing a lighter moment from his realization of retirement rumors, he remembered: “I did read a really funny comment at the bottom of one article: ‘I hope Chris forgets he’s retiring and comes back.'”</p><p>Speaking with Vanity Fair even back in 2022, he explicitly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">clarified</a>: “I’m not talking about retiring by any means.” And yet, the narrative of him evacuating from the movies for good began to shape.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chris-only-took-some-time-off-acting-for-two-reasons>Chris only took some time off acting for two reasons</h2><p>Ultimately, Chris did actually take somewhat of a step back from acting after the blockbuster Thor: Love And Thunder was released to theaters in 2022.</p><p>He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained</a> to Entertainment Weekly last year that “I decided to take some time off because I was exhausted, and I wanted to be home with my family”, spending time with his three children and his wife Elsa Pataky.</p><p>“It was interesting, because those two headlines got coupled together, that I was taking time off because of the genetic predisposition to Alzheimer’s,” he addressed, making sense of the confusion surrounding his faux retirement.</p><p>Audiences can breathe a deep sigh of relief in the knowledge that Chris isn’t going anywhere. In fact, his later movie is the action extravaganza Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, a prequel to the acclaimed 2015 epic Mad Max: Fury Road. It’s opening in theaters on Friday, May 24th 2024.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmltX2V%2BcK%2FHq6CsZZiaurTDzquroWWnlsBurc2nprKdlGK9prvPpZxmrJikwqi002afnmWhqra1ecCcq6Kml2K8t7HRZpilspiatq6x0axkoJ2emnqltdKcpq%2Bdoq58</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./2019-trends-knot-print-clothes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Knot Print Clothing Trend | 13 Pieces to Shop</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./apple-and-cheddar-scones.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>apple and cheddarscones</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
