I’m looking forward to him doing a good job tomorrow.</p><p>“It looks like his best distance is 1,800m but I think he can handle further in the future.”</p><p>Chau was in the saddle for three of Chill Chibi’s four Happy Valley victories – the most recent at 1,800m – and also had the reins when the son of Wrote stretched his legs in a recent 1,600m Sha Tin turf trial.</p><p>“I’m very happy with his trial. Normally when he trials he’s very casual. He doesn’t overuse his energy and he just does enough for the race,” said Chau, who has landed five winners from his past 20 rides. “He finished off very strong in his last gallop and he’s very well now.”</p><p>One jockey who hasn’t been seeing them quite as well as Chau recently is Zac Purton, who has been beaten on 10 favourites across the past two meetings, but the star Australian looks well placed to bounce back with a full book of 10 rides this weekend.</p><p lang=de dir=ltr>🏆38.

He does give me the impression that he wants further so it might be on the sharp side for him,” Purton said.</p><p>“But he’s first up and they can sprint well on debut sometimes, so I’m hoping that’s the case.</p><p>“He handles [soft ground], but there are different tracks in different parts of the world. A horse may handle a soft track somewhere else but not handle a soft track here.”</p><p>Purton also has a live chance aboard John Size’s Magnificent Nine in the Class Three Sustainability Handicap (1,400m), with his mount attempting to prevent Patch Of Theta ringing up his hat-trick.</p><p>A comfortable winner under Hugh Bowman two starts back, Patch Of Theta saluted under Karis Teetan late last month but will reunite with the Australian jockey on Saturday.</p><p>“He’s progressive and he’s a big, strong horse. Although he’s gone up in the handicap I don’t think carrying the extra weight will be an issue for him,” Bowman said.</p><p>“He’s still learning. Both his wins he’s had everything go his way and he hasn’t really had to work for it. But he’s learning as he goes and he’s certainly on an upward spiral.”</p><p>Comments</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mq5mTnruoe8Crq6KbnJp8dH6Ucm1rbV%2BbvLO5jKOcq6qpYrCprdRmmZqbm6h6qbvNoGSkp56ceqWx0ZuwZp6fqr%2B1tIycn6KknGKwqbXBomSsrKKeuKZ5yK1kpaefoMButMisZJudo6l6pbXSrZinm5U%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meaning-of-history-of-rap-6-by-jay-z.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meaning of History of Rap 6 by JAY-Z</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./family-friendly-holiday-happenings-in-the-quad-cities-and-beyond.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Family-friendly holiday happenings in the Quad Cities and beyond</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
