Makhdoom told the publication that they were at a bustling restaurant overlooking the New York skyline when they were introduced in 2011. She described the moment as “like being in a movie”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Makhdoom added that not many successful Pakistani athletes are well-known in the US and she was impressed that she had seen his poster around. Khan, for his part, told the publication that he knew he wanted to marry her: “You can always tell – you get that feeling when you gel with someone. She’s the perfect girl.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/02/090782ce-507a-4b2f-9fa7-e91c4acc2886_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Khan proposed in 2012 and, just 16 months later, they got married in a lavish wedding at the Waldorf Astoria in New York. Hello reported that although it was Makhdoom’s dream day, she told the publication it was also “sad” as she was saying “goodbye to my family and begin[ning] my new life as Amir’s wife in the UK”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">The rise – and plateau – of Snap Inc. billionaire Evan Spiegel</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Makhdoom was just 21 years old at the time and planning out her law career. That was before she met Khan. “But it’s funny, God does things in crazy ways and nothing goes the way you plan it. When it’s right, it’s not a problem,” she told Hello.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Her beauty business and YouTube fame</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Known for her carefully put together outfits and flawless looks, it only made sense that Makhdoom eventually turned towards make-up. Per The Asian Connect, Makhdoom launched her beauty line Faryal Beauty in 2022 with five shades of liquid lipstick.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On her website, Makhdoom said she knew she would always have her own make-up brand, as she was surrounded by fashion and beauty growing up in New York. However, her brand took on a different significance when her marriage with Khan hit a rough patch. In August 2023, during the couple’s multiple relationship hiccups, British media claimed that Khan pledged to invest a hefty sum of money into his “estranged” wife’s beauty business in a bid to win her over.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eight years ago, after marrying her famous husband, Makhdoom also started her own YouTube channel. Now, with over 152,000 subscribers, Makhdoom said at the time that she wanted to give fans a look inside her life: “I’ll be sharing my everyday lifestyle, my relationship with my husband, my daughter and of course, make-up and beauty.” Since then, Makhdoom and Khan have also starred in a three-part BBC show, Meet the Khans: Big in Bolton, which gives fans insights into their lives.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who is Nicky Hilton’s billionaire heir husband, James Rothschild?</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The Khan family</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/02/100fa857-e5fd-4a93-a521-e72c4509a0d9_96a17e0f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their first child, daughter Lamaisah, was born in May 2014. The couple have spared no expense when it comes to lavish parties, reportedly dropping £100,000 (US$127,200) on a second birthday party for Lamaisah in 2016, which included Disney princesses, Peppa Pig and a real-life ballerina, per Hello.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2018, they welcomed their second daughter Alayna and, in 2020, they had their son, Muhammad Zaviyar.

In 2016, Makhdoom accused her in-laws of bullying and abuse. Per The Guardian, Makhdoom’s detailed allegations prompted Khan’s family to respond on social media, starting a public row.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2017, Khan publicly accused his wife of having an affair with his friend and fellow boxing sensation Anthony Joshua.
