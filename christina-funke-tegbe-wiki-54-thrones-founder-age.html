Stay with this Christina Funke Tegbe Wiki to find out.</span></p><h3><strong>Christina Funke Tegbe On Shark Tank</strong></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Christina Funke Tegbe appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Shark Tank</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> with a story of how she launched the brand and its effectiveness. She shared that her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015. So, her aunt from Nigeria would send her mother shea butter for her mastectomy scar.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Considering its healing properties, Christina immediately got the idea to turn it into a business. She then quit her job and began her journey through Africa, where she built the infrastructure for her business.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her product used ingredients sourced directly from Ghana. “Our shea butter is picked from a tree. The fruit is picked, the outside is eaten, and the nuts are then processed into oil,” she mentioned.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But, after the COVID-19 pandemic, the company went to a pause due to the decreased demand for shea butter. Thus, she had to turn to the sharks, to save her business.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>After the deal, Christina’s products were featured by popular magazines like Forbes, Elle, and Vogue. Also, a few of her products went into discount under the label “Shark Tank Deals.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sharing her experience on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Shark Tank</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Christina took it to her IG to write, “Wow so that was fun!
