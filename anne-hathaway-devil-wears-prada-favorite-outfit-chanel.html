In a new <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=noopener>Interview</a> cover story, Hathaway spoke to friends, colleagues, and designers about her filmography — and of course, Michael Kors wanted to know which one of her Devil Wears Prada outfits was her favorite one. Surprisingly, it wasn't the internet's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=noopener>most meme-d option</a> (the Chanel boots), but her pick does involve plenty of double-C logos.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hathaway also mentioned that speaking about her style and her character's was a "chicken-and-egg question," because she felt "so influenced by getting to work with [costume designer] Patricia Field and having conversations with her about how to put outfits together." Field, who is also the mastermind behind the looks on the original Sex and the City and Netflix's Emily in Paris, helped Hathaway learn to love fashion — both in real life and for Andy Sachs, who undergoes one of the most beloved cinematic glow-ups of all time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And as for her favorite look, it involves a Chanel coat and enough Chanel necklaces to decorate a Christmas tree.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love what I wore to the James [Holt] party, that velvet Chanel coat that went to the knees, and then the miniskirt and the stockings and the slouched boots," Hathaway said.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She went on to explain that the outfit was probably a "sample," because she "kept finding straight pins in it." It wasn't the first time she picked that particular ensemble, either. She told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a> it was one of her favorite looks when she reflected back on the film in 2021.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There were [initially] no designers of note who would appear in the film. They just didn't want to incur the wrath of Anna. Some of them showed us their showrooms or gave us notes on the authenticity of the script; they just didn't want to participate. Initially, Pat had a hard time getting clothes out of a lot of the designers," director David Frankel told EW.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meryl Streep, who starred alongside Hathaway, compared fashion to special effects, saying, "Pat did a miracle with this. It's like all the special effects in Tom Cruise's Mission: Impossible movies, this is the female equivalent of that. It was her great relationships with all the wonderful houses, the designers, the people in the fashion business that she was able to, because she's so loved. She borrowed everything; We had to be very careful not to eat spaghetti at lunch, because it'd go down the front and they couldn't return it!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8CnpZ5lmJbBqa3WmrBomZ6jsm60wK2fmq%2BRrnqlsdWio2avlZa%2FtHnPq5idmV2brre70aKrnmWfqsGntdNmmqGZnpq5</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./coryxkenshin-youtube-racism-favoritism-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Black Gamer CoryxKenshin Slams YouTube for Racism and Favoritism</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./weird-flavored-chips-144177.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Weird Flavored Chips, Sodas, and Snacks We're Too Scared to Try</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
