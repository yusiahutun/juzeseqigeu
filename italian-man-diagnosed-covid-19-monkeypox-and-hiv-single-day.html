Tests revealed he also had monkeypox and HIV, according to a case study in the Journal of Infection.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 36-year-old patient, who was not identified by name in the report, is the first in the world to test positive for all three infections in a single day, the researchers said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Italian man reported that he developed a fever, sore throat and headaches nine days after returning from a trip to Spain. He tested positive for Covid-19 on July 2 – and his symptoms escalated past the typical presentation of the virus within hours.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">First, the man noticed a rash starting to form on his left arm. Small, painful blisters appeared on his face, torso, legs and backside the following day. As the blisters continued to spread and turned into telltale pustules, the man decided to seek emergency care at a hospital in Catania, Italy.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/05/20/clean_0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:28</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">What is monkeypox and should we be worried that it’s spreading?</p><p>What is monkeypox and should we be worried that it’s spreading?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On July 6 – just a few days after his first symptoms – the man was diagnosed with a co-infection of Covid-19, monkeypox, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). His case shows how early symptoms of monkeypox and Covid-19 can overlap, and underscores the importance of testing for other sexually transmitted infections after a diagnosis of monkeypox, doctors wrote in the report.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The man’s body was dotted with lesions that looked like monkeypox in various stages of progression when he arrived at the hospital. Pustules on the palm of his hand and the side of his foot were bulging with pus and haloed in red. Other sores had turned into scabs with depressed centres – one of the telltale signs of the virus.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The lesions also affected the patient’s perianal region, which has been typical in the recent outbreak. Experts suspect a likelihood of sexual transmission of monkeypox because the outbreak has mainly affected men who have sex with men in their intimate regions.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">New ‘highly virulent’ HIV strain discovered</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since the patient disclosed that he had unprotected sex with other men on his holiday to Spain, doctors tested him for monkeypox and ordered a full STI panel upon his intake at the hospital. According to his medical history, the man also had syphilis in 2019 and was negative for HIV as of his last test in September 2021.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is likely that his HIV infection was fairly recent, based on his sexual history and immune markers that looked normal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This particular case “emphasises that sexual intercourse could be the predominant way of transmission” of monkeypox, doctors wrote in the report.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As this is the first known co-infection of Covid-19, monkeypox, and HIV, doctors do not yet know how the trio of viruses could affect a patient’s condition.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Italian patient recovered well, with almost all of his monkeypox lesions crusting over after a few days in hospital. He received an infusion of Sotrovimab, a monoclonal antibody therapy, to treat his Covid-19 infection and improved the next day.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/08/25/WEBclean-Japantoeasecovidrestrictions.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:00</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Japan to drop Covid-19 test for vaccinated travellers despite having world’s highest case tally</p><p>Japan to drop Covid-19 test for vaccinated travellers despite having world’s highest case tally</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By day six in hospital, most of the man’s symptoms had resolved. Swabs for Covid-19 and monkeypox were still positive, but he had no new skin lesions and was discharged to home isolation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When he returned for a follow-up visit, the patient’s sores had healed “almost completely, leaving a small scar”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He was put on treatment for HIV, which included the antivirals dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine, according to the report.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXymwdGop55nkafBqq%2FLnmZsaWllf3KCjqKrmqSZlrtuucCnZJ2hkZy7sL%2FEnWScp6aesW59mGakqKabmsaxu9dmmKecXZ22t3nSoqWgpJVisaLF</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meghan-markle-altuzarra-suit-wellchild-awards.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meghan Markle Wears an Altuzarra Suit to Wellchild Awards with Prince Harry</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brad-pitt.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brad Pitt: News &amp;amp; Updates From Award Winning Fight Club Actor</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
