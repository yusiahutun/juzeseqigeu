We're gonna turn that myth around, if we share what we learn with each other.

I kept it off by coming up w/an hour workout I do a few times a week," explained Olivia. "The weight loss leaned out my cheeks and jawline. Working out is also great for your skin because it increases blood flow to your face which helps rejuvenate."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/290f2c7f6c8c-olivia1-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ecFy8SVXC9pX data-wc=9><strong>Olivia revealed how she got rid of her sunspots</strong></p><p id=ePAbrXTEyopy data-wc=4><strong>Change of eyebrow arch</strong></p><p id=e3fc1PWfjg63 data-wc=78>"Reshaped my brows. I do my own brows and always thought they were supposed to have a high arch. Then a facialist pointed out to me that I was shaping my brows into a frown," she confessed. "So I let the top of my brows grow in (which is never fun because it looks spotty for a few weeks) and then I plucked the bottom. That gave my brows a more horizontal angle and instantly brightened my eyes."</p><p id=eZ-zWcWK6mwz data-wc=6><strong>Sticking to a daily skincare routine</strong></p><p id=edMMkzzl8Sf9 data-wc=86>"Got rid of sunspots. I love my freckles. But over the past couple of years I've seen more come up and merge with other freckles to make large dark spots," the Magic Mike actress revealed. "Dark spots prevent your skin from reflecting light and gives you a dull complexion. So for the past year I've been diligently using @Proactiv Mark Fading Pads. I wipe my face with one every night and now my face has a more even tone and the large spots aren't as noticeable."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b3df3667d435-olivia2-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eL__OSqk2b3p data-wc=10><strong>The star shared her secrets for youthful and radiant skin</strong></p><p id=eBTS3ZdRmfY1 data-wc=4><strong>Eating the right foods</strong></p><p id=e9CFIpXF7qXx data-wc=69>"I've talked about this before and I still stand by it: Japanese potatoes that are high in Hyaluronic Acid help keep wrinkles away," she told her followers. "Look up this video: "Connie Chung Yuzihara" to learn all about it. There are Hyaluronic Acid pills and vitamins but I think that the best way to get it in your system is by eating them in foods that naturally have them."</p><p id=es4ZOe_Tz_iT data-wc=3><strong>Doing your research</strong></p><p id=ey2OvMLZsi6U data-wc=38>"I'm still looking into what gets rid of the lines that develop around your neck.
