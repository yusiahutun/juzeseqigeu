Obviously. Would you really expect anything else from the costume designer of the latest iteration of The Baby-Sitters Club? “Maybe there was some Dawn earlier in my life,” she allowed. “But definitely, at this point, I’m a Claudia — my own version of a Claudia.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qur3000x3h6e3gyy9sn8@published data-word-count=85>As in the Ann M. Martin books, which devoted paragraphs to scrunchies-to-sneakers descriptions of the BSC girls’ outfits, fashion is a crucial part of the ten-episode <a href=#>Baby-Sitters Club Netflix series</a>, which kicks off with the BSC origin story — <a href=#>Kristy’s Great Idea!</a> — and follows the girls through the summer after seventh grade. Summers’s challenge: Staying true to the styles of the beloved characters from the ’90s while bringing the babysitters to the present day.&nbsp;(Well, almost to the present day. There’s no COVID in Stoneybrook.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5quvl000z3h6eizf00bzz@published data-word-count=130>“We definitely wanted to make sure that, whenever we could, we’d give a nod to the style of the ’90s and even some of the book covers,” Summers said by phone. (You may have noticed that the staging of one of the <a href=#>first press photos</a> from the series is a nod to <a href=#>the cover of the first BSC book</a>.) It helped that some of the characters were into vintage clothing — sorry, but yes, the ’90s qualifies as vintage now — and that ’90s styles are back, with some tweaks and twists. And though Summers didn’t grow up with the books, her daughter did, and “so many [of my crew] are from that generation that read them originally.” Read on for Summers’s breakdown of dressing a new generation of babysitters.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckcc5quk4000w3h6e2k52rkax@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Claudia Kishi</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/696/e5c/5551d70c337c5fb2df92dc200e0850a58d-baby-sitters-club-costume-design-2.rvertical.w570.jpg> The one and only Claudia Kishi (Momona Tamada), forever fashion icon.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5quy200103h6e3b6q4qm5@published data-word-count=4><strong>Played by: </strong>Momona Tamada</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qv2d00133h6ei2oyoue3@published data-word-count=51><strong>The look: </strong>As all BSC fans know, Claudia is an artist and her wardrobe reflects her eclectic, pop-bright sensibility. Paragraphs in each book were dedicated to detailing her outfits, which were always vivid, unique, and, objectively, the coolest. <a href=#>Entire fandoms</a> were built around taking inventory of Claudia’s closet, cataloguing every look.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qv5a00153h6et698hyhn@published data-word-count=102>“The fun part of Claudia is she looks in her closet every day — whatever she is feeling that moment, she dresses to it,” Summers said. “And it’s not standard fare, obviously. It’s crazy tops that she’ll put with these pants that are mismatched, but everything she puts together works. She has a great eye. She’s an artist!” For instance, Claudia has a pair of coveralls that, if you watch closely, get more and more paint on them as the season goes on — at first incidentally and then later deliberately, as she doodles on her clothes to make them more her.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qv7r00163h6e6qcc8c2n@published data-word-count=96><strong>The story: </strong>Tamada is “very petite,” Summers said — a good four inches shorter than her fellow club members. So Summers had Claudia wear lots of platform shoes and boots — very on brand for the larger-than-life Claud, plus it got her “on the eyeline with the rest of the girls.” (“Her bun was part of the whole thing too,” Summers added. High buns! Useful advice.) “Everything was a little oversize on her, so we’d belt things … and roll up her pants to be a few inches above the ankles to give her better proportions.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qvax00173h6ee556xth6@published data-word-count=108>Claudia’s room is BSC headquarters, so Summers made sure to have “pieces of fabric lying around her bedroom that were from outfits that she wore, so you could see that she made and created some of her pieces.” Subverting the (honestly overrated) counsel of Coco Chanel <a href=#>who supposedly advised</a> would-be chic women to look in the mirror before leaving the house and take one thing off, Claudia piles on the accessories. A go-to for her was <a href=#>Konplott</a>, because “a lot of their jewelry can be vintage-inspired looking, but it’s also bright and fanciful, and that also worked with our age demographic and the standoutness of Claudia,” Summers said.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qvd200183h6ejxhs4oze@published data-word-count=109>The vision board for Claudia’s aesthetic was “kind of amazing,” Summers said. It was built around an illustration from one of the book covers, magazine tear-outs, and Japanese-American art. Speaking of which: Because Claudia’s family is Japanese-American, they adhere to the Japanese tradition of removing their shoes when they come in the house. Which, for a costume designer, “was really hard for me at first,” Summers said, laughing, “because I really dressed them from head to toe,” but all the girls would have to be shoeless whenever the BSC met in Claudia’s room. So keep an eye out for some interesting socks and for Claudia’s red fluffy kitten-heel slippers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ebf/b00/0cc711e93622d83fd94de4fcef0c89fbb6-baby-sitters-club-recap-ep-09-placeholde.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Yes, those pants are a nod to Alicia Silverstone’s unforgettable Clueless yellow plaid.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qvi500193h6e8brrk267@published data-word-count=114><strong>A ’90s Easter egg for you: </strong>In the premiere, we go from a scene with Kristy acknowledging that her mom — played by Alicia Silverstone — “isn’t totally clueless” (!) to a BSC meeting in which Claudia is wearing pants in that iconic Cher Horowitz yellow plaid. I thought I was possibly hallucinating this/outing myself as a borderline-psychotic fan of Clueless, but Summers assures me that this was all 100 percent intentional. “Once we did get Alicia, and got into Claudia and the color and prints and fantasticness of who she is, yes, it is totally a nod to Clueless, and to her character Cher, and to <a href=#>my friend and amazing designer Mona May</a>.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckcc5qur5000y3h6ekv9zacdo@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Kristy Thomas</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/dbc/f24/ae39306eb26715e3b3f5d8606141955f06-baby-sitters-club-costume-design-4.rvertical.w570.jpg> Kristy “No Muss, No Fuss” Thomas (Sophie Grace)<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qvno001a3h6ejs0o2a4w@published data-word-count=4><strong>Played by: </strong>Sophie Grace</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qvqy001b3h6eydq50bse@published data-word-count=26><strong>The look: </strong>A forever tomboy.

She’s in this pale sky blue, which has a really beautiful criss-cross back to it. It’s simple but a little more body-revealing than her character would probably ever do.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6fa/24a/7a606cd905cdfd69bb04b5bb417ffb6192-baby-sitters-club-recap-ep-08.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Kristy’s bridesmaid’s dress for her mom’s wedding “really brought out a side of Kristy that she didn’t even know was there,” says Summers.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qw7f001f3h6e7trl4dez@published data-word-count=73>“It’s an awkward thing when you’re a girl who doesn’t wear dresses to have to go out and find something formal and floor length,” Summers said. “It was a real and joyous moment for all of us.

Even her rolly backpack. It’s just, like, seriously? Poor girl.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qwio001i3h6e4v01177w@published data-word-count=42>Even as Mary Anne found her new look, “we had to stay within our parameters of the original look of her … [but] show that she’s a young girl and not a baby.

In the Netflix series, Mary-Anne is biracial, and this adds a layer to her father’s behavior — much of his rigidity is rooted in his insecurity and fear about trying to prepare his daughter for the world when he is terrified about how cruelly the world could treat her.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qwoc001k3h6eqyuvi007@published data-word-count=92>“She hasn’t changed since her mom passed away, and her dad can’t move on,” Summers said. “And the growth from there had to be something that’s believable. If she turned into a Claudia or Stacey, her dad would clearly never let her out the door.” So Mary Anne’s evolution is a little more subtle: “We took the silhouette and just made them a little more figure-flattering, for starters. The pinafores became a skirt, and it’s a little bit shorter … We added a blouse or a sweater with some style in it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ba9/de9/7230c2b7357f9d6a4bce69fa6e9e11d650-bsc-3.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> “Maybe the biggest part of the story for [Mary Anne] and her dad letting her be herself is her taking her hair out of her braids.”<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qwr5001l3h6emxpeptzz@published data-word-count=85>But the biggest change for Mary Anne is her hair. “I think that’s brilliant because, as we know, Black girls’ hair is everything,” Summers said. “And maybe the biggest part of the story for her and her dad letting her be herself is her taking her hair out of her braids, wearing it down and up in different ways. It was a really wonderful opportunity for her to express herself … Plus, Malia has the most amazing head of hair. It’s just gorgeous and beautiful.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckcc5qv1g00123h6eawt2dtja@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Stacey McGill</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/d27/745/69513934665d6619be22ec77f3d41d149a-baby-sitters-club-costume-design-1.rvertical.w570.jpg> Motorcycle jacket?

Sometimes she’d have a scarf wrapped around her neck in a way that would not be odd on a 25-year-old but “you don’t see a lot of kids in school dressed like that.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qx3h001p3h6e4g3fgpir@published data-word-count=48>Stacey has diabetes (this comes up frequently in the books … her blood sugar is basically a junior member of the BSC), so it was also necessary to incorporate her insulin pump, “which got bedazzled by the prop department in colors that worked with her palette,” Summers said.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qxhy001q3h6elpyal32l@published data-word-count=45>Even though Stacey is the boy-craziest of the bunch, she’s “still in that mind-set of: I’m a girl; I dress for girls.
