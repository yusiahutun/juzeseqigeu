The details about his parents and siblings have not been shared with the media yet. But he had a paternal grandfather whose name was William Somerville. He grew up in a joyful and supportive environment. Frank completed his high school studies at Berkeley High School and was graduated in the year 1976. Later for his further and higher studies he went to San Francisco State University. By looking at his career he must have gained knowledge about Journalism.</p><h3>Frank Somerville Career</h3><p>In 1981 he began his career by working as an intern at KTVU. After he completed his studies he began working at local stations in Santa Rosa, California, Providence Rhode Island, Minnesota, and many more places in the field of Journalism.

Recently on a Sunday broadcast, he was seen slurring in his speech while on air. So the KTVU News Director Amber Eikel has allegedly taken him off-air until further notice. The issue also raised concern over his health. For now, he might be taking a break and will be sharing his views through his social media account.</p><h4>Controversy</h4><p>In 2013 he had to apologize for an incident on Asiana Airlines Flight 214 where racist pilot names were read out on the broadcast. After that incident, he has been careful while speaking. He also keeps his personal and work life separate and away from the media.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Frank Somerville Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Frank William Somerville</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>19 March 1958</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2021)</td><td>63 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>San Luis Obispo, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Journalist</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Pisces</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Frank-Somerville-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 9” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 175 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 85 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 187 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>11 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Average</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>Berkeley High School</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>San Francisco State University</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Frank-Somerville-3.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Is he a Gay?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Wife?</td><td>Donna Wright Somerville</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Two (Callie Somerville,&nbsp;Sydney Somerville)</td></tr></tbody></table><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u0d171c56312c91d48b6e0d8fa1879d35><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Jilana Cotter Biography</span></a><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Frank tied a knot with Donna Wright Somerville who is a Television producer.
