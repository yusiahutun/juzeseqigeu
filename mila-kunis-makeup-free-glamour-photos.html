"I don't wash my hair every day. It's not something that I associate with myself. I commend women who wake up 30, 40 minutes early to put on eyeliner. I think it's beautiful. I'm just not that person."</p><p>And though the 32-year-old star is clearly comfortable with stripping her face of makeup, would she ever ditch her clothes for a nude selfie?</p><p>"If you have a great body, go for it!" she says in a behind-the-scenes video from the shoot. "I don't care!"</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/cc/o/2016/07/06/ccccd57abaa35e839e0bb3c17a4cb999_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Steven Pan for Glamour</span><p>One thing she's definitely against is Photoshop. "I hate it," she declares. "There was a company that I did a photo shoot for once that manipulated the photo so much, I was like, 'That's not even me.' Like, what's the point? You wanted my name, and then you wanted the version of me that I'm not. I absolutely hate it."</p><p>Mila says she isn't opposed to a little help, but nothing that changes the way she actually looks. "Now, do I sometimes want them to depuff my eyes? Help me out with a little bit of lighting," she admits. "But do I want them to stretch my legs, thin out my waist, curve my hips, elongate my neck, blah, blah, blah? No."</p><p>The <strong>"That '70's Show"</strong> alum is definitely confident, which is something that has helped in her relationship with husband <strong>Ashton Kutcher</strong>. In fact, the brunette beauty says he knows everything about her.</p><p>"There's nothing we don't know about each other because we've known each other for so long: the ugly, the bad, the good," she says. "We can't bulls--t each other. I literally can't lie to him. He can call me out on everything, and I can do the same, because there's nothing about the other person's face that we don't know. We know when they're acting, thus we know when they're lying."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d3/o/2016/07/06/d3cc6e41474255ffa781c05bd01a6f1a_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Steven Pan for Glamour</span><p>The couple is expanding their brood yet again -- Kunis is pregnant with her second child. She says it's her family that has gotten her through the ups and downs of motherhood. "I have an amazing, amazing support system in my house, meaning my husband who's incredible!"</p><p>As for what she's learned about children so far? "Children are f--king crazy," she jokes. "They're also suicidal. Like, at the park, certain jungle gyms have an opening for older kids to jump out of. She's 19 months; she can't jump. She just walks off it as if she's on a pirate ship."</p><p>"Another important thing to learn is that kids have a personality that has nothing to do with you," she reveals. "I have a really sweet daughter. She wants to hug all the other kids. I didn't teach her to be sweet. It has nothing to do with me. I've realized you can control only so much."</p><p>For more of Mila's interview, check out the new issue of Glamour, on newsstands July 12.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnd7j3BmaW5foratrYykrKeho2K6orfErqdmnqKasm6zy5qkqK2iYr2pu9Ooqmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./millie-bobby-brown-tie-dye-dress-jake-bongiovi.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Millie Bobby Brown stuns in a tie-dye maxi for day out with fianc Jake Bongiovi</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meghan-markle-princess-diana-aquamarine-ring-heartbreaking-story.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meghan Markle: The heartbreaking story behind her aquamarine ring tribute</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
