The overall theme of the song seems to revolve around the struggle to maintain a reputation while battling personal demons and the consequences that come with it.One standout lyric that catches the attention is "Take my own life just to save yours."

The theme here revolves around the internal conflict within oneself, acknowledging one's mistakes and seeking redemption. It explores the concept of self-forgiveness and acceptance, illustrating the internal struggle of coming to terms with past actions and moving forward, even if forgiveness from others may be elusive.The line "Please, just stay away" takes on a different meaning, emphasizing the theme of self-preservation.

This theme highlights the internal battle between a desire for companionship and the fear of causing harm or being hurt. It delves into the complexities of one's own reputation and the desire to protect both oneself and others from potential harm.Throughout the song, the repeated phrase "I got a reputation that I can't deny, You're the superstar, entertain us" brings attention to the theme of external pressure and the expectations placed on individuals by society. It reflects on the struggle to maintain a certain image or reputation, even when faced with one's own personal struggles. This theme explores the concept of fame and the constant need to perform or entertain, revealing the vulnerability and internal conflicts that may be hidden beneath the surface.In the verses, several themes intertwine to create a raw and introspective narrative. The line "I was born to raise hell, I was born to take pills" presents the theme of self-destruction and the chaotic nature of one's own existence. It explores the idea that some individuals feel destined to engage in destructive behaviors, trapped in a cycle they cannot escape. This theme delves into the internal battle between one's desires and realizations, acknowledging the choices made that contribute to personal struggles.The line "I was born to fuck hoes, I was born to fuck up" examines themes of promiscuity and self-sabotage.
