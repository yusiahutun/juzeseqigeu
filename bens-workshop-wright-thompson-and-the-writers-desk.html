On this week's episode of Ben's Workshop, Ben worked&nbsp;with a piece of Cedarwood cut down from the property of Roanoke in Oxford, Mississippi, the home of Nobel Prize winner, Pulitzer Prize winner, and Poet Laureate— William Faulkner. Talk about a good story!</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/491A8375.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ben said,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"I have been waiting for a project that was worthy of the provenance of this piece of wood. Today, another writer is coming to town, another Mississippi son, and my good friend, Wright Thompson."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Wright Thompson is a senior writer for ESPN. He's written for ESPN 30 for 30 series, and his books&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Cost of These Dreams</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;and Pappyland became New York Times bestsellers. Most have read his stories on Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, and Leo Messi, but most don't know that Ben has&nbsp;cried reading all of them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/491A8415.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Ben and Wright are on a mission to build a writing desk from Faulkner's cedar and then donate it to the creative writing department at Ole Miss, their Alma Mater.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ben said,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"Just think of the stories this piece of wood&nbsp;could tell and think of the all the stories that will be written at this desk for years to come."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/491A8392.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Wright and Ben got straight to work, but not without taking a moment to relish in the rareness of the build. Ben mentioned that being a southerner and sentimental go hand in hand. In Wright Thompson fashion, he said something wise and beautiful and almost made us cry in the first two minutes of the episode.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Wright said,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"I'm a big believer that wood carries the life force in it. I have knives made from the barn on the farm where my dad grew up. I think Faulkner wrote about that most, which is the idea that there is this past that is slipping through your hands very quickly."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/491A8437.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He continued,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"If you drive around here [Laurel], the nostalgia is thick. So much of the ideas behind his work [Faulkner] live in the fact that we're taking something old and dead and making it new and alive. I write on a table made out of wood from an old house that collapsed in Clarksdale, where I'm from, and it's beautiful. I think that even when we leave where we're from, you want to carry pieces of it with you."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ben and Wright begin their project by turning legs for the writing table. Using a lathe, they design the legs to pay homage to William Faulkner and every other writer's most dangerous tool, the pencil.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/491A8478.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ben asked about Wright's journey of becoming a writer. Wright said,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"I have the best job in the world. I've got to do some cool stuff. The Cricket World Cup in India comes to mind. If you would have asked me, a kid from Clarkesdale, Mississippi to draw up my dream scenario.. the places I would go and the people I would meet, I couldn't have made this up. I feel deeply, sincerely grateful."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It all began when Wright was assigned to the sports section in the college newspaper. As a sports fan, he was thrilled but never expected to be thrown into the throes the way he was. He said,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"We got sent to go cover the Super Bowl, and I guess the NFL didn't know we were student paper. They just sent us these credentials, and we got to go to all these fancy parties, and we had to buy sport coats.</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/491A8482.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He continues,</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;"Most people were geeking out about the athletes, but we were all geeking out about the sportswriters. I love writing about athletes because the psychological cost of doing this significant personal thing in public is tremendous."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ben immediately got into his favorite questions about Lionel Messi and his interview with Michael Jordan. Wright laughingly answered,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"Wait, who is that?"</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He goes on to say,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"It's Michael Jordan. The fact that he's Michael Jordan wears off pretty quickly, and he's just a guy who is sitting around telling jokes, smoking cigars. He has, as you can imagine, really good cigars. We watched basketball, and it was interesting because he had a sophisticated scouting report about LeBron James. He'd be watching and then shout He's going left!"</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/491A8443.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"It became immediately clear to me that this dude is sitting at home, mentally preparing for games that he won't ever play. He talked about how he spent his whole life turning himself into this weapon. Now all of those traits that he worked so hard to nurture, develop and protect, not only are they useless, but they are the things that are keeping him from enjoying any of this."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ben went on to ask about Wright's two newest works,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Cost of These Dreams</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Pappyland.</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;Wright says,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"The fact that you liked it [Pappyland] and don't drink is the reason I thought we might have something here. It's&nbsp;a bourbon book that's barely about bourbon. My wife makes fun of me and says it's Eat, Pray Love for dads."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/IMG_8346.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>When the woodworking was done, they admired their table, and Ben may have been tempted to keep it forever. They loaded it up and headed to Oxford to donate it to the Writing Center at the University of Mississippi.</p><p>When they arrived, Wright and Ben carried Faulkner's writing-table up to its new residence where two professors and two MFA students greeted them. The Writing Center allowed them the privilege to use the writing table first and write something meaningful about the history and its legacy.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Screen_Shot_2022-01-05_at_4.43.25_PM.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/IMG_8355_cac313c8-7695-494a-9df1-a89588a99518.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p>Poem by Hussain Ahmed, MFA Student at the University of Mississippi</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It was a special event for Ben, Wright, and all those in the room. Ben said,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"From the moment this piece of wood came into my shop, I knew it needed to be a writing desk. Creating it with one of my all-time favorite writers and then giving it back to the University of Mississippi is such a full-circle moment. We have built some fascinating things in our shop, but this piece is a masterpiece. I'm proud of it."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7ra3Uq5ylpZWnsKK606KjnmaTpLpwrsuonqxnmqTCs7rApWabnZ6oeri70aSqoaegYsSztcahq2asmKS6sb%2FOp2SappRiwamxjLCpoqyVp8BusMSsog%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./christi-paul.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Christi Paul Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./eugenie-devane-husband-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>William Devanes wife Eugenie Devane Biography &amp;amp; Personal Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
