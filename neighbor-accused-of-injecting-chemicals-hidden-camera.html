He told the outlet the complaints would be over anything from footsteps to drawers closing, while texts viewed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>WFLA</strong></a> also allegedly showed Li say he couldn't sleep and could "hear the toilet seat being moved."</p><p>Following the complaints came a mysterious odor in Abdullah's apartment, he said, telling FOX that his eyes started to burn and his daughter began coughing and throwing up. The smell -- which he described as more "obnoxious" than nail polish remover -- prompted the father to try and find a source for it inside their apartment, with Abdullah saying he eventually replaced the water heater, called the fire department for assistance and cleaned all the vents and air ducts, all to no avail.</p><p>Eventually, he noticed a crack in his doorway and decided to install a hidden camera in a plant outside their apartment ... checking the footage after his daughter again fell ill.</p><p>"I installed a hidden camera outside because we were suspecting someone is tampering our place from outside and then we caught our neighbor injecting something through our door," Abdullah told FOX. "On June 27, I found that our neighbor is coming with a syringe, he's pulling something from a vial and then he's injecting through our entry door."</p><p>Video shared from Abdullah to the outlet appears to show just that. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>See the raw footage here.</strong></a></p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:707ca3ba-5051-422e-83ed-44c89370fff2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:a54276be-9457-440b-ad05-3b2fef118104 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/9c/5by4/2023/08/09/9ca6cd683425447bb5cb291fa15287d4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Woman Exclaims 'I Didn't Do Anything' After 3 Lunch Guests Die from Suspected Mushroom Poisoning</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"If we could not have found that incident on the camera, probably after a few days we might have been just dead," he told FOX -- while also telling WFLA he and his family "were shaking" when they made the discovery. "We can't imagine that he is coming and doing something," he added.</p><p>Abdullah then called the police on Li, who was arrested June 27 and released shortly after. He has since been charged with multiple accounts of battery and possession of a controlled substance. Li's attorney told WFLA that he pled not guilty and "all the facts will come out in due course of time."</p><p>According to FOX, Li was recently a chemistry PhD student at USF, but the school said he was no longer enrolled there. WFLA, citing a Tampa Police Department affidavit, said a hazmat test found the liquid "chemical agent" contained both methadone and hydrocodone.</p><p>"If people use their knowledge, this extreme knowledge to harm people, they could be even more dangerous," Abdullah told FOX. "I can never expect a neighbor ... to expect something that to happen. I wish no one else would have to go through a situation like this ever in their life."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2d62011a-011e-43f1-82d0-6e8bf8f8226e data-container-ref=toofab:article:a54276be-9457-440b-ad05-3b2fef118104 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4d/5by4/2023/08/24/4dd38e5da2fc43a8ba84504768f4fe2a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty/Osage County Sheriff’s Office</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">BTK Killer Named as 'Prime Suspect' In Two Murders, Daughter Details First Meeting In 18 Years</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fma21fo7Kqs8ebpqtlkZiwtr%2FEnWSonl2eu6uxwq2gp59dmLWmucicmKWrXZ22pbDEp2ScmZ2av6J7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rihanna-golden-pony-hair-dress-alexander-mcqueen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rihanna Embraces Her Wild Side In a Golden Pony-Hair Dress</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./love-island-cally-jane-beech-shook-tears-ai-pictures-nude-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Love Island's Cally Jane Beech left 'shook and in tears' after finding nude AI pictures of herself o</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
