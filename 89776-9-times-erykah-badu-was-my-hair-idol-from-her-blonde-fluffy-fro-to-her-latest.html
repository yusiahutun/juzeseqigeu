When you combine <a href=# class=T3D>Erykah Badu's new bowl cut</a> with every other hairstyle she's ever had, you can understand why she's definitely my hair idol. As I've grown, the way I interpret her music has changed — much like her hairstyles. With each change (of her hair, that is), I gain a little more courage to reach outside of the box when it comes to my own 'do.</p><p>From belly-length braids to a her many epic afros and even a <a href=# class=T3D>buzzcut</a> (my personal favorite), the list goes on and on. All making this new severe chop less than a surprise. Badu unveiled her new look on <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Twitter</a>, with one of her simple, yet striking shots. "Shroom," Badu captioned, quite accurately. Her new hairstyle is basically the bowl cut everyone rocked in elementary school, but way cuter, due to its thickness. Maybe it's the humidity talking, but I've been out of my mind when it comes to my hair, so Badu's new cut is here just in time. I do wonder though, how is this style going to change her natural styling?</p><p>All of my excitement aside, this is definitely not the first time Badu has ventured out. In reality, she's being doing this crazy hair swap things for years! As a result, i'm left with one wish: for Badu-like hair. Maybe I'll be brave enough to go where her strands have gone in this lifetime. Until then, check out the 9 times Erykah Badu was my hair idol.</p><h3>1. Bowl Cut</h3><p>Since this is the latest, it should be the first. While everyone else is going natural (she's been there), Badu decides to go without. Now that's a real trendsetter, people.</p><h3>2. Blonde Fluffy Fro</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Jason Merritt/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Even though it may be difficult to see, Badu totally makes it work. Not only do I love the color of this hairdo, but I also love the size. It's really hard (and slightly frightening) to wear a big style like this, and I think she does it with ease.</p><h3>3. Original Black Fro</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Kris Connor/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>This fro was part of her look, back in 2003. And it's still as cool as it was then, today.</p><h3>4. Belly Braids</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Kevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Again, Badu is showing off another look that's hard to pull off. But it looks so fitting, on her. She looks like what everyone hopes to look like at Coachella.</p><h3>5. Buzzcut</h3><p>This is totally my favorite look. Mostly because I have buzzcuts on the brain, but also because of how simple it is. Her face is the main attraction, for once.</p><h3>6. Straight Blowout</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Brendon Thorne/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Although I often talk about natural hairstyles, I'm not against straight hair. I actually have my hair straight a few months out of each year, just to switch it up. Honestly, Badu's length is a goal for anyone, natural or not.</p><h3>7. Thick Braids With Braided Bang</h3><p>I will probably never try this look, but it's a great example of a time Badu hit the mark with something so different. Be sure to peep those amazing beads at the bottom of her braids.</p><h3>8. Classic Scarf Turban</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images News/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Once again, Badu was rocking scarf styles long before us. I feel like it was one of her Baduzims. My question is though, did she have help? Because I can't understand how she got all of those in there. Cleva lady.</p><h3>9. Big Black Fro</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Rachel Murray/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>The thing I like about this one is that as similar as it is to her original fro, it has so much more texture, and it's definitely fitting of a DJ queen.</p><p><i>Images: Getty Images</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHx5hZZwbWZxXam2rrHSZpyrsZuWtW6uwJ2sZq%2BRqHquxYyhmKKqXZ6xsLiMn6mopV2dsrN5waWmp5yVYrOtwcWfsGaeoqR6tbuMoZyrZZyWwaa%2F0w%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./heirs-black-couple-beach-property-taken-1924-sell-area-la-county-20m-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Heirs of black couple who had beach property taken in 1924 to sell area back to LA County for $20M</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-belted-coats-we-love.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>25 best belted coats to shop now in the January sales at up to 70% off</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
