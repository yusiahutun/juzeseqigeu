However, walking to the cage and in the first seconds of the fight, I was very nervous because one never knows what is going to happen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Then I started to move and the more I threw strikes, the more relaxed I got. I could feel on what level my opponent was, and it all became clear. I knew what to do to win.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/20/d9a1c92b-02c2-40ac-9c86-2602f34239ef_01421098.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The tournament moves into its semi-final stages as part of the blockbuster UFC 280 event in Abu Dhabi this weekend and so far the tournament has pretty much done what it says on the box.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Out of the early rounds in Singapore have come fighters from six Asian nations, with markets the UFC already has represented among its men’s ranks – China, Japan and South Korea – and a few – India, Indonesia and Thailand – the MMA world at large probably doesn’t know that much about.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The simple equation is that the more a fighter wins the more we want to know about them and as one of the most impressive winners of that first series of fights – he simply overwhelmed Indonesia’s Angga Hans (13-4) in a second round TKO – Lu is keen to share his story.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">UFC turns spotlight on surging Asia talent in new tournament format</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lu’s journey has taken him from Shanghai to the Czech Republic, where he is now based, as he chased his dreams and sought opportunities to fight and expand his skill set.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now there’s a fight against South Korean Lee Jeong-yeong (8-1) this Sunday that would put Lu one fight away from a UFC contract – should he win in Abu Dhabi.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What we saw from the 27-year-old Lu in Singapore was a fighter feeling his way, at first, and then quickly realising he was a class above his rival.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I was getting ready for my fight, many people were telling me that my opponent was very skilled and I should be careful,” Lu said. “Then, during our fight, I found out we were on a completely different level and I didn’t have a problem beating him.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 26-year-old Lee comes made of far sterner stuff than Hans. His own performance in June was fierce – he took on the experienced Chinese fighter Xie Bin and had him tapping out to an armbar in just 36 seconds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And Lee comes with a record built on the ultra-competitive Korean circuit that includes a featherweight title with Road FC and a record of six finishes in his eight wins.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Lu pointed to his 12 years in judo as evidence of his readiness for the bout, and dismissed suggestions he was “not ready for it”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People don’t see what’s behind it all,” he said. “Since I was very young, I was training in a judo team. That means two or three training sessions per day, six days a week.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If we were lucky, we got one week off in the whole year. When I was 20 I was on the top of our national rankings and under huge pressure. I am very clear about what real training looks like, what an athlete’s life is about, what both success and failure feels like.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China has three fighters in action this weekend. Joining Lu in the semi-finals will be Qiu Lun (16-8) up against South Korean Choi Seung-guk (5-1) in the flyweights, and another featherweight in Yi Zha (20-3) who’s up against Japan’s Koyomi Matsushima (13-5).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Win, and they’ll next be fighting for a UFC contract, and that is exactly what Lu has his sights set on.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I know exactly what to do to get where I want,” he said. “I spent many years at the sports university where the focus was mainly training. While my teammates were sleeping or playing games, I was reading and learning. I knew that if I want to get to the top, I need to constantly improve in every aspect.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“After my first fight of the tournament, many people got to know me and they follow me now but for me, this is not enough. I hope soon that people all around the world will know my name.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mppmiqbaiuIyaqa2rX6K2ubHDZqSaqqSerq15wKurrGeRp8Gqr8ueZmxpaWuCd4SOq6aanF2qs6R5y65kpJmZYrmmrcOsZJygmaOutHnCoZirn5Vir6qzjK2gpp1dl7mwr8qbrKyslad6oq7UZpuhmZKeeqbCxKer</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rob-halford-and-thomas-pence.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rob Halford and Thomas Pence</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-linda-caicedo-related-to-moises-caicedo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Linda Caicedo related to Moises Caicedo?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
