The controversial reality show&nbsp;Jackass&nbsp;debuted on MTV and ran for three seasons from 2000 to 2002.</p><p id=par-2_28>Knoxville parlayed the success of the franchise into eight movies and several spinoffs. The most current film,&nbsp;Jackass Forever, recently premiered in theaters and on the Paramount+ streaming network.</p><p id=par-3_34>Fans still can’t get enough of the <a href=#>death-defying stunts</a>, crude humor, and zany physical comedy. The&nbsp;Jackass&nbsp;franchise has undoubtedly earned its place in pop-culture history as one of the raunchiest shows to hit the airwaves.</p><p id=par-4_40>Over the years, the cast has put themselves in <a href=#>severe physical danger</a>, often landing them in the emergency room. Destruction of property is not unheard of, and Knoxville recently recalled an incident where a rental car was damaged beyond repair.</p><h2 id=h-the-infamous-rent-a-car-crash-derby-featured-in-2002-s-jackass-the-movie>The infamous rent-a-car crash derby featured in 2002’s ‘Jackass: The Movie’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jackass-The-Movie-Johnny-Knoxville-2002.jpg><p id=par-5_31>In 2002,&nbsp;Jackass: The Movie&nbsp;was released in theaters and meant to be a final farewell to fans. It was met with great success and sparked the making of many more wild films.</p><p id=par-6_48>One of the most famous stunts in the first movie involved a rent-a-car crash derby. <a href=#>Knoxville</a> rented a car in good condition. It only had a few scratches on it when it left the lot. After filming the memorable scene, he had to return the car in pieces.</p><p id=par-7_41>Knoxville spray painted a No. 3 on the sides and roof of the white car, smashed out the windows, and had roll bars installed. He then competed in a demolition derby that left the engine on fire and the vehicle demolished.</p><h2 id=h-johnny-knoxville-had-to-return-the-rental-car-on-a-flatbed-truck>Johnny Knoxville had to return the rental car on a flatbed truck</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-8_41>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Dukes of Hazzard </a>actor returned to the rental car company with the destroyed car. As Knoxville pulled his inflatable passengers out of the back seat, he ran away from the lot, laughing and yelling “F.U.” to the confused rental car attendant.</p><p id=par-9_30>In a recent episode of the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WIRED</a>&nbsp;Autocomplete Interview, when Knoxville was asked if he paid for the rental car, he responded, “Yes, we pay for everything we break. We’re not assholes.”</p><p id=par-10_36>The actor explained, “That was the rental car smash-up derby from&nbsp;Jackass&nbsp;No. 1, where I rented a car, had it modified for a crash-up derby.” He said, “I think we had to return it on a flatbed.”</p><h2 id=h-is-johnny-knoxville-ready-to-retire>Is Johnny Knoxville ready to retire?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-11_42>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Things</a>, Knoxville has an estimated net worth of $50 million. He was instrumental in the franchise’s success, and although he has cut back in the past decade on extreme stunts, he is still the most recognized cast member of the&nbsp;Jackass&nbsp;franchise.</p><p id=par-12_50>Born and raised in Knoxville, Tennessee, the 50-year-old actor’s real name is Philip John Clapp. Known for pushing the limits, the father of three came up with the idea of testing self-defense equipment on himself.&nbsp;Jackass&nbsp;co-creator Jeff Tremaine encouraged him to film the material, which turned into the MTV original series.</p><p id=par-13_48>Knoxville explained to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>&nbsp;that he thought the franchise would end when the TV series was over. The&nbsp;Bad Grandpa&nbsp;writer said OSHA cracked down on him, saying, “You can’t do this! You can’t jump off anything higher than four feet!” The controversial actor said, “It was impossible to do the show.”</p><p id=par-14_25>Jackass&nbsp;left the small screen and found unprecedented success in theaters. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Numbers</a>, the eight movies brought in approximately $572 million worldwide box office sales.</p><p id=par-15_51>Knoxville has endured countless physical injuries filming crowd-pleasing stunts. He has had numerous broken bones, herniated discs, concussions, and even a <a href=#>torn urethra</a> that forced him to wear a catheter for three years. Recently, the madcap stuntman received a brain hemorrhage after a prank with a wild bull went seriously wrong.</p><p id=par-16_53><a href=#>Jackass Forever</a>&nbsp;may be the last of the life-threatening stunts we see from Knoxville. The pop icon recently told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, “You can only take so many chances before one forever catches up with you.” He explained, “I realized that it’s amazing that I’m still walking around. I think I pushed my luck far enough.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3sLTNp7Bmo56kxbe1y6WcZquRnrFusMSsq6unqZqxbr7Ep6uapF2YrrN5yZqapJmjqHqzsdOuqaedlGKzra3Tm5ydZZ6kwW60wKmnsmaYqbqtew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./libra-horoscope-june-2023.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Libra Horoscope June 2023: Career Breakthroughs</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./525174-dci-releases-video-suspected-mavoko-land-cartel-buyers-build-houses-plot-ni-kujenga.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>DCI Releases Video of Suspected Mavoko Land Cartel Asking Buyers to Build Houses: &amp;quot;Plot ni Kujenga&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
