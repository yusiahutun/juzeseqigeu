Given that Purdue won it last year, will the reigning champs repeat or will one of the other thirteen competing teams steal the show? Regardless of which school you’re rooting for to win it all, you’re likely wondering <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/culture/1361825/how-to-watch-march-madness-2023/ rel="noreferrer noopener">how to watch the Big Ten championship game</a> live for free.

This year, 14 teams are battling for the Big Ten Tournament Champion title, along with the conference’s automatic bid to the NCAA tournamnet (A.K.A. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/culture/1361825/how-to-watch-march-madness-2023/>March Madness</a>).

If Purdue takes the crown in 2024, it would become the Big Ten’s first repeat champion since Michigan won back-to-back titles in 2017 and 2018. However, Michigan State has won the most titles, holding six total under its belt.</p><p>It’s not uncommon for a Big Ten team to make it into the Final Four of March Madness. Michigan State has done it three times, while Illinois, Ohio State, Wisconsin, and Michigan have done it once each. Purdue has won the Big Ten tournament for a grand total of 10 times. With a clinched spot in the Big Ten quarterfinals and Zach Edey on the roster (he is chasing his second straight Most Outstanding Player award), could Purdue do it for a second consecutive year?</p><p>If you’re a men’s college basketball fan, you won’t want to miss the Big Ten Championship.
