I never even switched it on.”</p><p>Though the name of the man never got revealed by Joss, the source reports the mysterious man to be involved in the profession of music promoter. The relationship between the duo started in the year 2014, which further got flourished in 2015. Joss further described her current relationship to be enchanting and passionate, where she said:</p><p>'Our relationship is very intense, very up and down. I annoy him; he annoys me, we split up every Thursday and then makeup. But he challenges me, and I totally respect him, he’s as strong as I am, he knows his mind.’</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Similarly, she also revealed her man to be her music inspiration.

That song This Ain’t Love, that’s about my current boyfriend. I was so pissed off with him. And then Stuck On You is how I feel the next minute. I told him I wrote a song about him and wanted him to listen to it, and he does, but he doesn’t listen to the words, just the beat. That’s such a bloke thing to do.”</p><p>From a passionate lover and a singer Joss too has a secret desire of being a mother but fears to take the leap due to the instability on her career, where the singer thinks stability is a must to raise a child, where she said:</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“I always figured I wanted kids, seven kids. But now I’m thinking that having a baby would not be right. It’s not enough just to want one. It has to be right.&nbsp;Kids need stability I don’t have stability. I never really have had that, but for a child, that’s all you want for them so, at the moment, I think it wouldn’t be right for me to have a baby.”</p><p>Till the late year of 2015, the singer was still with her unexplained man as&nbsp;in an interview with the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> telegraph.co.uk</a> when asked about her perfect traveling plan she revealed about traveling with her man to be a perfect vacation, she said:</p><p>“My boyfriend - I never like to go away without him.
