Having only joined the team competition this year, Rahm and Hatton have yet to suffer the fate of the likes of Bryson DeChambeau, who has dropped to 182nd.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their LIV colleague, Joaquin Niemann is arguably one of the best players in the world at the moment. He won the Australian Open in December, earning a spot at this year’s Open Championship in the process, and followed that up with wins in Mayakoba in February and last week in Jeddah.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But he is presently ranked 76th, and has needed invites to get into the Masters and the PGA Championships.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[If] anybody in this world, for example, doesn’t think Joaco [Niemann] deserves to be in the top 10, or isn’t a top player in the world, I don’t know what game you’re watching,” Rahm said. “I think anybody who watches golf can tell who the best players in the world are, and obviously I don’t think the ranking is reflective of that right now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/1919fcbc-f4c1-4d7c-b11f-769239f7d423_580db40f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Schauffele, who is competing at the Arnold Palmer Invitational this week, said there was no doubt LIV had players “that are in the top 10 or top 25 in the world … they’re just unranked right now”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cantlay, meanwhile, had no update on merger talks between the PGA Tour and LIV’s backers, the Saudi Public Investment Fund, but was asked if the OWGR were broken because the criteria don’t include LIV players.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think the world rankings has a very particular set of criteria and I don’t know if broken is the right word, but I think that there has been so much uncertainty and change in the last couple years that it’s inevitable that things need to be updated or changed,” Cantlay said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Matt Fitzpatrick, who is also playing at Bay Hill, went a step further, saying he no longer paid attention to them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I look at Data Golf as a better representation of how people are playing in the world,” he said. “I think the ranking side of it [golf] is a little skewed. It’s missing a lot of top players.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Given the failure of the game’s governing bodies to find a way beyond the current impasse, Rahm was asked whether it might be time for players on all tours to force the issue.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Spaniard said he hadn’t given the situation “that much thought”, but pointed out that it should not fall on the players to make the rules.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’re here to shoot low scores and give the spectators what they want to watch,” he said. “It’s the governing bodies job to be doing this and be adaptable to the changing environment.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1moKecm3yivtOimqWdX2h%2FdoCSbWtopJmreqi7y59koaeenHqsu82gZKmkka6ys7%2BMmp6rnZVixLC%2By51kq5meoLavs9JmpZ6dlGKwqa3NoJxmqpGdum6%2FwLKqZqyZorJutMCsZKmqn6uypXnSsqqtnZ1ir6Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./melissa-arbuckle-baby-lily-victoria-mental-health-mistakes-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Melissa Arbuckle: Judge finds cries for help from mentally-ill mother were ignored before she killed</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./caribbean-coast.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Caribbean Coast | South China Morning Post</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
