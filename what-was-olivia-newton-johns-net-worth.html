The multi-talented star was a very successful singer, songwriter, and movie star. The news of Olivia’s demise on August 8, 2022, shook the industry; however, she lived a life worthy of emulation.&nbsp;</p><p>Olivia, born in Australia, started singing in her teens before moving to England in the mid-1960s. There, as a relatively new act, she performed in clubs and on television.&nbsp;Her first big break into the American music scene <a href=#>started </a>with the release of her third solo album, “Let Me Be There,” in 1973. The album’s title track earned her a Grammy Award for best country female vocal performance.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/28/c2/cc/28c2cce6988f7c0c4a59654db9cccbd1.jpg><p>Afterward, she started building on her initial success with the release of further projects. Olivia’s success continued with the release of top tracks like “Have You Never Been Mellow” and “I Honestly Love You,” which won the 1984 Grammy record of the year.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Olivia has starred in a couple of movies, she could not replicate her musical success in the movie industry. However, that all changed when she got cast in the 1978 film adaptation of the Broadway musical “Grease.”</p><p>The singer portrayed virtuous cheerleader Sandy opposite actor John Travolta who played Danny, a rough around the edges but tender greaser. Fans and Critics praised their performance, and today, “Grease” is one of the most successful musicals in movie history.</p><p>After years of making albums and movies, Olivia took a break in the mid-1980s. She subsequently launched a clothing store called Koala Blue and started her own family. Then, after a while, she returned to the entertainment scene, where she remained a big draw for decades.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Olivia_Newton-Johns_Net_Worth></span><strong>Olivia Newton-John’s Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Olivia enjoyed a lot of success in her entertainment career as a recording artist and actress. She is regarded as one of the best-selling artists in history, selling more than 120 million records.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout her career, she released a total of 25 albums with top charting songs like “Physical,” “I Honestly Love You,” and “Have You Never Been Mellow.” She also starred in multiple notable movies, including “Grease,” regarded as one of the best-selling musicals of all time.</p><p>Olivia was also a successful movie producer; her works include the 2001 television film “The Wilde Girls” and the 2009 documentary “Big River Man.”&nbsp; <a href=#>According to Celebrity Net Worth,</a> Olivia Newton-John’s had a net worth of $60 million.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Olivia_Almost_Missed_Out_On_%E2%80%9CGrease%E2%80%9D></span><strong>Olivia Almost Missed Out On “Grease.”</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although Olivia was already a big recording artist before starring in “Grease,” the movie remains the biggest highlight of her career. Over 40 years since its release, “Grease” is still the highest-grossing film musical ever made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, when Olivia released her autobiography, the Hollywood star revealed she almost did not star in the movie. Instead, according to Olivia, she met the film director Alan Carr at a dinner party where he suggested she would be the perfect person to play Sandy.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>However, Olivia, 28, would star opposite Travolta, who was 23 years old at the time. The idea did not feel good to Olivia, who noted she could not play a high school girl at her age.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, most of her movies before then had bombed, and she was scared “Grease” might turn out the same way. Surprisingly, everything changed when Carr sent Travolta to talk to her. Olivia <a href=#>wrote</a>:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“I went outside to be greeted by those piercing blue eyes and the warmest smile on the planet. In-person, John Travolta radiates pure joy and love. That day, he greeted me with a big hug like we were already lifelong friends. How could you say no to John Travolta?”</strong></p><p>Afterward, they agreed to a screen test to decide if they had on-screen chemistry. However, before they even said a word, everyone on set could see how perfect they looked together. The duo had an electric connection, and it’s no surprise the movie did so well commercially.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Olivia_and_Travolta_Were_Deeply_Attracted_To_Each_Other></span><strong>Olivia and Travolta Were Deeply Attracted To Each Other</strong>&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Olivia and Travolta’s connection was very easy to notice for people who watched them star in “Grease.” But, undeniably, the duo also felt the pull they had for one another.&nbsp;After “Grease” was released in 1978, the duo became the subject of persistent romance rumors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/f8/3b/36/f83b36c63f3341e552df5e60f5524f11.jpg><p>However, Olivia and Travolta never took their relationship physically. Instead, they remained very close friends for 44 years keeping their relationship strictly platonic.&nbsp;I’m her autobiography “Don’t Stop Believn,” Olivia stated the reason she and Travolta never hooked up despite their connection. The music star <a href=#>stated</a>:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“Yes, we really liked each other, and there was an attraction, but we would never date because we were both involved with other people at the time, and both of us have a loyalty streak that runs deep.”</strong></p><p>Yet, throughout the filming period, the duo enjoyed a strong flirtation that everyone could see. They also helped each other out, with <a href=#>Travolta</a> once messing up a scene to silently encourage Olivia to do better in the next take.&nbsp;</p><p>Olivia noted that they almost got intimate with each other multiple times throughout filming but never crossed the line. She explained that life offered them wrong timing, and they had to leave it as friends.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Olivia_Battled_Cancer_For_Three_Decades></span><strong>Olivia Battled Cancer For Three Decades&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Olivia’s battle with cancer started in 1992 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. The singer, 44 at the time, initially did not want to make the information public. However, when she learned a publication was going to write she was dying of cancer, Olivia disclosed her diagnosis.&nbsp;</p><p>She <a href=#>underwent </a>a partial mastectomy, chemotherapy, and breast reconstruction. All these procedures helped, and she went into remission for about 20 years after her initial diagnosis.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Sadly, in 2013, Olivia’s cancer returned. According to the actress, she noted a lump on her right shoulder but thought it was from a minor traffic accident she had earlier tha year. However, further tests showed that her cancer had returned.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015, Olivia created “The Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness & Research Center.” The center, situated in Melbourne, runs hundreds of clinical trials for brain, bowel, breast, and other cancers. It also offers inpatient wards and serves as an outpatient ambulatory center.&nbsp;</p><p>Olivia received further bad news when she was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer in 2017. However, the star maintained s positive stance that she would recover and her journey would inspire others.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2020 she and her husband created the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund to help research plant medicine and how it can help treat cancer. Sadly, just two years later, on August 8, 2022, the veteran star <a href=#>succumbed </a>to the disease aged 73. The family has since asked for donations to be made to her foundation to honor her memory.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKmt02aumqtdpLmqwsiaZKedp6m8r3nJqJ%2Bnq12jsrV51qipraBf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./415914-bobi-wine-bio-wife-children-parents-net-worth-house-facts-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bobi Wine bio: Wife, children, parents, net worth, house, facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./306489-latest-african-fashion-dresses-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>TOP Latest African fashion dresses to try out (with pictures)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
