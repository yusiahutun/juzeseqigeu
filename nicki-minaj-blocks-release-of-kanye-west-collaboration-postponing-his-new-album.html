release of Kanye West collaboration, postponing his new album</h1>This article is more than 1 month old<p>New Body, which dates back to 2018, was expected to be released on Friday on West’s album Vultures, with West instead announcing first footwear project ‘since liberation from Adidas’</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Nicki Minaj has blocked the release of New Body, a collaborative song with Kanye West, causing a postponement of the release of West’s new album Vultures.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>West was due to release Vultures, a full-length collaboration with vocalist Ty Dolla $ign, on Friday. But shortly after the expected release, he posted a message to Minaj on social media reading: “May I call you about clearing new body on the new album”.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Minaj responded on an Instagram livestream, saying: “Regarding Kanye: that train has left the station, OK? No disrespect in any way. I just put out a brand new album. Why would I put out a song that has been out for three years? Come on, guys.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>New Body, an ode to plastic surgery, actually dates back even further, to 2018, when it was earmarked for West’s scrapped album Yandhi. It was then re-recorded for 2019 gospel album Jesus Is King, reportedly with a more spiritual bent and with a new Minaj verse, though that version was also never released. Minaj complained in 2019: “I done wrote three different verses chile, and I don’t know. We ain’t seeing eye to eye on it.” The song was also reportedly mooted for inclusion on 2021 album Donda. Minaj has since described the song as “the hit that got away”.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Since the release of Donda, West made a series of antisemitic statements that were widely condemned. Shortly after West praised Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party, Joe Biden put out a statement reading: “The Holocaust happened. Hitler was a demonic figure. And instead of giving it a platform, our political leaders should be calling out and rejecting antisemitism wherever it hides. Silence is complicity.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>A series of companies cut ties with West following his remarks, including Adidas, whose collaborative Yeezy trainers had been a huge success for the sportswear brand.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>In lieu of the delayed Vultures, West has now announced Yzy Pod, “our first product since liberation from Adidas”, a sock-like footwear design priced at $200 or £159. The shoe is described as “the foldable future of footwear”.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Earlier this week West announced a new head of design at his Yeezy company, the Russian designer Gosha Rubchinskiy.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Rubchinskiy became a fashion world darling with his streetwear label, operated since 2012 as an arm of Comme des Garçons, prompting collaborations with Adidas and Burberry. But in 2018 he was accused by a 16-year-old boy of pressuring him to send explicit photographs, which Rubchinsky denied. A company spokesperson said Rubchinskiy was asking for casting shots: “Gosha has been doing casting by Instagram for many years now. It is a normal practice nowadays.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>This week Rubchinskiy announced he has left Comme des Garçons and is operating as “an independent creative powerhouse” while heading up Yeezy.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>When Vultures is eventually released, it is expected to have collaborations with vocalists Chris Brown, Kodak Black, Young Thug and more, plus producer Timbaland.</p><figure id=3757ba61-fa00-4b7e-9dec-2e3414b2a6f0 data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement class=dcr-1your1i><a href=# class=dcr-1m887w9>Nicki Minaj: Pink Friday 2 review – ‘You’re never far from a glowing endorsement of her own vagina’Read more</a></figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>Minaj released her new album <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Pink Friday 2</a> last week, which is expected to chart in the UK Top 3 this week.
