'I could not imagine that my future had already been written in the stamp of a fake passport before I was even conceived.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As the youngest of three siblings with a ten-year age gap, Cheryl was the center of her family's universe.

Why did we risk it all?' she writes in real-time. 'That answer is simple. We were being hunted.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Beginning at a very young age, Cheryl noticed that her father, George, checked into hotels under different last names. 'Most often Cash, Sterling, and Gold, my father seemed to like money-related names.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was never clear where their money came from, she said, 'I'm taught to shoplift, but that's just to build character.' Nonetheless, money was 'always there, just a wire transfer away. Ready to buy us freedom.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When they moved, it was always sudden and generally involved frantic packing, leaving possessions in storage facilities (or not) and dashing to the airport to go wherever Cheryl's father decided - by looking at the upcoming flights leaving that day.<span class=mol-style-italic>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Life on the road meant that most lessons were taught on the fly, said Diamond. 'Since Dad considers all educational institutions breeding grounds for government propaganda and square-thinking bureaucrats.' Lessons in core subjects like math, and writing were few and far in between, taught by her mother mostly on the swirling carpet of five star hotels while on the run.&nbsp;<span style=font-size:18px></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span style=font-size:18px>But her hardest lesson was something very different, she said. '</span>I had to learn our rules:' 1) Always have a back story. 'With each new country, Dad not only changes our last name, but also builds a different history, a different place we're from,' she wrote. 'He drills me in mock interrogations when I least expect it.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>2) Never give outsiders your home phone number. Instead, set up an answering service in a different town where people can leave a message after the beep. 3) Forward all mail to a P.O. Box and take abrupt turns, circuitous routes before picking it up. 4) Pay for everything in cash.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Nothing was as important as their cardinal rule: 'When you leave a place—no matter how much you love it, no matter how many friends you've made—you can never, ever go back,' she writes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So deeply ingrained were these guidelines that Diamond never dared to question them at first.

(They had never lived anywhere longer than eight months before). Her family moved into a grand secluded two-story mansion which they furnished with plastic outdoor patio furniture, that 'seemed like a good temporary option when we moved in.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She recalls the awkward practice of meeting kids her age for the first time, 'Why is it that the more ordinary a situation is, the more it paralyzes me with anxiety?'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But for a brief moment, Cheryl got to experience a standard childhood: she was involved in competitive swimming and gymnastics, she enrolled in a puppet theatre group, joined an abacus club and took a children's art class.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She didn't take any of it for granted. 'For the rest, there will always be next summer, next year,' she said. 'For us, everything we are tasting maybe for the last time.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A few weeks later, clothes, books, and toys were scattered on the floor as her family frantically packed their suitcases. George's Vancouver business partner in a get-rich-quick scheme started asking too many questions, and spooked the family when he showed up at their front door demanding answers earlier that evening.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By 4am, Diamond said, 'it looked like a tornado had torn through our house.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The drill was always the same: destroy all evidence of life, wipe finger prints and change names. They burned all important documents, and threw away other distinguishing items in random garbage bins on the way to the airport.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Within three hours, they were boarded on a flight to Germany with 14 suitcases in tow, leaving most of their belongings behind.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The concept of travelling light fascinates me,' said Diamond.

Without any documentation of prior education (or any record of existence for that matter), they trade on the fact that she lived in Israel to get in.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We have all emerged from a fog a couple years ago, fully formed, yet lacking any history.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For a short while, Cheryl's life had all the hallmark trappings of a typical teenager: boys, jealous friends, school dances, and insecurities. But despite her best attempts to fit in, she said, 'This gap, between my life and theirs, seems too wide to bridge. An impossible chasm filled with terrible secrets—all the things that make me strange, different.' That feeling will follow Cheryl well into adulthood.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I suppose what it all boils down to, is this, I know how to survive, and they know how to live.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And just when things started to seem all-too-easy, she says, 'I'm reminded how far away I am from normal.' Whilst everyone else was out, Cheryl's father shows her the loose floorboard in his closet tha<span style=font-size:18px>t hid a nondescript black backpack containing their passports, $10,000 in cash, $5,000 in gold Krugerrand coins and a burner phone. 'I'm being put in charge of our family's escape plan when I'm barely thirteen.'</span>&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By the time Cheryl turned 16, life on the lam had taken a toll on her family. It had been four years since she last saw her brother. To this very day, he is still missing.&nbsp;'Some secrets are unspeakable,' she says.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her sister, Chiara, ran away from home and threatened to get in touch with her grandfather - causing George to uproot the decimated remains of his family to North Carolina.&nbsp;His paranoia and unpredictable temper became more capricious as he started to loose his vice-like control over his family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Years of lavish spending on&nbsp;<span style=font-size:18px>custom-made tuxedos, luxury cars paid for in cash, mansions, and private dance lessons had left them destitute and living out of a rental car parked in a strip mall.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Mom and Dad trying to think of anyone left who might help—but that's the problem with vanishing with such skill for decades.

'I always thought that people would see me as a freak because what I lived was so outside the bounds of normality'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But in this state of total despair, Cheryl was given a crack in the impossible when a modeling agent scouted her outside a pawn shop. New York City offered the promise of hope, 'a way to pull us out.' And without pause, Cheryl (still going by Crystal at the time) bought herself a fake&nbsp;North Carolina state ID card and hopped on the next bus to the Big Apple to start her new life as 'Cheryl Diamond.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For the next five years, she survived hand-to-mouth hustling between runways and photoshoots, posing for brands like L'Oréal, Clairol and Armani. At 19, she published<a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>&nbsp;</a>her first <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>memoir </a>about her experiences in the modeling industry.&nbsp;Without a valid ID though, she had to collect her book advance through an LLC set up by a friend.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I'm adept at deflecting questions but live in constant fear of being found out.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By the time Cheryl turned 24-years-old, she was done. Done with running, done with living off the grid and done following her father – whom she now believes has a 'severe undiagnosed mental illness of some kind.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Flimsy $30 fake IDs were no longer tenable and Cheryl was desperate for legitimacy. The problem is, she technically doesn't belong to any country.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While her New Zealand birth certificate is a legally issued document, her parents are listed under false identities and forged Brazilian nationalities. The dilemma poses a legal nightmare. There is no haven&nbsp;for children in the home countries that their parents abandoned. If Cheryl were to claim citizenship in any country, she would be held accountable for continuing the fraud her parents started.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After many years if legal maneuvering, she was finally granted Luxembourgish citizenship at the age of 27.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was only then, that she began to see the wool of her father's deception more clearly. 'All the places, all the things we would end up leaving behind. Why was it all necessary?' she pondered. 'He'd said it was because my grandfather and Interpol were chasing us. But was it because he'd stolen all that money, or was it . . . because it's easier to make a family do what you want when they are terrified?'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now living in Rome, the 'nowhere girl' has finally found a place where she belongs. After a life perpetual motion, she finds stability and comfort in the ancient city's history.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her memoir is a testament to the indomitable human spirit and a decade-long labor of love that she said, 'started as a way to rectify the feeling of not belonging to the world.' The prologue reads, 'This is for the misfits.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I used to think that I would never be truly accepted by other people if they knew about my history,' she told DailyMail.com. 'I always thought that people would see me as a freak because what I lived was so outside the bounds of normality - and also very traumatic and abusive at times.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'That was also a big reason why I wrote Nowhere Girl,' she says. The more she opened up about her past, the more Cheryl realized how many people could relate with their own struggles. 'Of course they didn't have a story as crazy as mine – that's one in a million!'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The thing I really like about being an adult is that you can choose your family.' The only person Cheryl maintains a relationship with is her mother. She hasn't spoken to Chiara in 10 years, and has no contact with her father. 'I think blood is only important if those people act like your family and care about you in that way,' she says.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When asked if she could go back and change the family that she was born into, would she do it? She responds, 'But then I wouldn't be me either.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKGd4OTbmdwZ3OdsrPFy2Z7opmdpLulecyom56kXZe8s7qMqKytpJGserS8xKerZpuYnrmltM6om2ahnqmys7rAraCoppGheqfBxqKroq6VYrK3rcOipaBleaPBpr7PqKNnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kyle-richards-mauricio-umansky-tough-conversations-with-daughters-about-split.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kyle Richards &amp;amp; Mauricio Umansky's Tough Conversations About Split with Daughters Revealed on Buying</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./beyonce-plaid-short-suit.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Beyonc Delivers a 101 on Power Suits Via a Plaid Short-Shorts Set</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
