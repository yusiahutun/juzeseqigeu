Thank you to everyone who waited out the storm to party with me - what a beautiful crowd.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p id=ejp209VEifv data-wc=52>"I had to rock paisley with 60's inspired platform boots for this historic location – what a blast from the past! Next up back to my home province for @ottawabluesfest! #QueenOfMeTour." Her followers agreed that despite the rain, Shania was worth the wait, with many calling the show her "best performance yet".&nbsp;</p><p id=eudfd9qqJw data-wc=35>Shania is touring the US before hitting the road in Europe to promote her new album.

Speaking of how their collaboration came about, Shania explained: "I really loved that particular [song]. At the time I said, 'Do you mind if I take that and play around with it for a while'. We never talked about it again.&nbsp;</p><p id=er1RA5QCeR data-wc=57>"So, to him, he was already detached from it… I ended up taking it into the studio and I only played it to Eja when it was all done. I didn't want him to feel weird about it. It was more of a surprise to him, he was like, 'Oh gee momma I forgot about that one.'"&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8619d98dc441-shania-twain-son-eja-z.jpg><p id=ejCQqtrbgd data-wc=37>Revealing Eja's reaction when she told him his song had made her album, she said: "He just thinks it's cool.
