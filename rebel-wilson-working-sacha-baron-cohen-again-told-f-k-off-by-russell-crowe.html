That last one had fellow guest <a href=#><strong>Alison Brie's</strong></a> jaw hanging wide open in awe and jealousy.</p><p>While the book covers Rebel's life to this point and dishes on all kinds of people and topics, the chapter on Sacha quickly dominated the headlines ahead of the book's release.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:eb8d30fe-350e-44f0-8d96-50ee8b95bd1a data-container-ref=toofab:article:63a3b0b8-587b-4ba9-bad0-df93d3674210 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0f/5by4/2024/03/26/0fd14f8e265d4f9aab2a0179ca06c56d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Rebel Wilson Claims She's Hearing More Stories About Sacha Baron Cohen Amid Memoir Drama</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In it, she alleges the "a--hole" comedian asked her to do a scene nude and put her finger in his butt, which he has denied. She also claimed before the book's release that Sacha's camp was trying to block publication of the book and threatening her.</p><p>"While we appreciate the importance of speaking out, these demonstrably false claims are directly contradicted by extensive detailed evidence, including contemporaneous documents, film footage, and eyewitness accounts from those present before, during and after the production of The Brothers Grimsby," said a rep for Sacha.</p><h3 class=h3>SBC, Adele & Russell Crowe</h3><p>In light of all this, Andy Cohen asked her how much money it would take for her to again work with SBC, to which she promptly replied, "No money ever. I now have no a--holes policy with work."</p><p>He slowly worked his way up to a staggering $50 million, to which Rebel still balked. Fellow guest Alison Brie seemed a little taken aback by that staggering number, and Rebel's lack of interest, but she would be even more shocked when Rebel started talking about her billionaire friends later.</p><p>The topic came up during a game of "Plead the Fifth" in which Rebel was also asked about her book's assertion that Adele hates her. The Pitch Perfect star backed down a bit on that one, but did explain why she felt that way.</p><p>"At these big parties, you know, the Oscars and stuff, pretty much everyone is friendly," Rebel said, except for Adele. "I went, 'Ah, congratulations on the new album,' you know, and then she just, like, turns away."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a5a4e64f-25e5-435d-8c71-4a4c9cd955a6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:63a3b0b8-587b-4ba9-bad0-df93d3674210 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c0/5by4/2024/04/04/c044fc3ac2e74508bded55c4987bff58_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Rebel Wilson Says She Was 39 When She 'Truly Experienced an Orgasm' and It Was Solo</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I don't know, she might not know who I am or there might not be anything there," she then conceded. "It just might have been those few times."</p><p>Proving she was willing to be open about whatever Andy threw her way, Rebel did not plead the fifth, as she also went into further detail about the time, per her book, Russell Crowe told her to "f--k off" at a restaurant.</p><p>According to Rebel, the Gladiator star dropped the f-bomb on her when she was trying to give a program of a theater play she was in to his dinner companion, Nicole Kidman. She said he just turned and barked at her.</p><p>When Andy asked what she'd say to him now, she didn't have to speculate, as she's seen and spoken with him since that memorable experience. She said she told him what happened, and he replied, "Yeah, that sounds right."</p><p>"That's just him," she said of the New Zealander (who grew up in Australia), calling him a "legend."
