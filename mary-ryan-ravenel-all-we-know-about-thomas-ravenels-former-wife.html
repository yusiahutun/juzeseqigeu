She was reportedly born in South Carolina, but details about the time are hazy.&nbsp;</p><p>Mary attended Charleston College and earned a bachelor’s degree in arts. Afterward, she furthered her education by getting a master’s degree from the University of South Carolina.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mary_Ryan_Ravenel_Career></span>Mary Ryan Ravenel Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before getting hitched to Thomas, Mary sought fulfillment as a teacher in South Carolina.&nbsp;She returned to it again after they got divorced, working as a special education teacher at an elementary school in South Carolina.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside her professional job, Mary is also an active community member. She is highly invested in the Charleston community and reportedly engages happily in charitable activities.&nbsp;She has a seat on the board of directors for the Charleston Animal Society, and her impact has been felt positively over the years.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Long_Was_Mary_Ryan_Ravenel_Married_to_Thomas_Ravenel></span>How Long Was Mary Ryan Ravenel Married to Thomas Ravenel?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thomas Ravenel and Mary Ryan Ravenel tied the knot in 1995. However, their union was not destined for longevity.&nbsp;The pair went their separate ways just 13 months later. The divorce process was legally finalized three years later, in 1998.</p><p>Details of what caused the two to split were kept between both parties. Until now, factors that contributed to their separation, as well as their settlement, remain shrouded in mystery.&nbsp;</p><p>They had no children together, and following their divorce, her former husband stopped speaking about her.&nbsp;When he appeared on “Southern Charm,” where he had to interact with other women romantically, Thomas never talked about Mary.&nbsp;</p><p>Since they got divorced, Thomas has been romantically linked with several women. Mainly while he was featured on “Southern Charm.” While on the show, Ravenel had a relationship with his co-star Kathryn Dennis. It ultimately led to them having two kids together: a daughter named Kensie and a son named St. Julien.</p><p>Unfortunately, the two were embroiled in a nasty custody battle that started after they split.&nbsp;It lasted until it was resolved in November 2019, with the court granting them joint custody of their kids. At the time, Dennis announced the development on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>She <a href=#>wrote</a>: “Just want to let my fans hear from me officially that Thomas and I have resolved all matters related to our children. I believe that this joint custody arrangement is in our children’s best interests. Happy to move forward. Thank y’all for all of your patience, support & love – kd.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Thomas_Ravenel_and_Kathryn_Dennis_Custody_Battle></span>Thomas Ravenel and Kathryn Dennis Custody Battle<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The custody arrangement is no longer the same for Mary’s ex-husband and Dennis. Thomas Ravenel reignited his custody war with Kathryn Dennis when he filed for sole custody of Kensington and Saint.&nbsp;He also requested that Dennis be granted only supervised visitation with the kids on October 23, 2020.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kathh.jpg><p>Dennis temporarily lost custody of their two children in February 2021. However, in February 2023, a South Carolina judge officially granted Thomas complete custody.&nbsp;</p><p>According to one source, the ruling came after Kathryn “failed multiple drug tests.” She reportedly <a href=#>tested</a> positive for “three illegal drugs.”</p><p>The source also claimed Thomas’ legal team had amassed evidence alleging neglect against Dennis.&nbsp;Thomas ultimately won sole custody because the children seemed to progress better in his care.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Thomas_Ravenel_Married_Now></span>Is Thomas Ravenel Married Now?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thomas Ravenel has only ever been married to Mary Ryan Ravenel.&nbsp;He almost married again when he fell in love with registered nurse Heather Mascoe.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair got as far as getting engaged, and Thomas felt good about their relationship. So much so that he vowed he would not draw up a prenuptial for their wedding because he didn’t feel he would need it.&nbsp;</p><p>Their engagement came up five months after they welcomed their child, a son they named Jonathan Jackson Ravenel, on June 29, 2020.&nbsp;Sadly, not long after their son’s birth, they broke up. At the time, he referred to what they had as friendship.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/30707192-8506459-Thomas_Ravenel_has_become_a_father_once_more_after_welcoming_the-a-11_1594646624505-768x1024.jpg><p>He said: “That’s how I’d put our relationship, really good friends. She’s happy, and I’m happy.”&nbsp;</p><p>There are speculations the two are back together, but one thing is sure — there has been no wedding yet.&nbsp;In the meantime, Thomas is enjoying life as a dad. With Jonathan’s birth, he joins people like <a href=#>Nick Cannon</a> and Robert De Niro, who have multiple baby mamas.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqK%2B2GapspmeYr%2BiwsSnnKVlkaG5bsPEZqKnp6dirqO71K1kraCfoq60edGarZ6mlaHAbrLOq6Seql2stqexjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jerome-alexander-magic-minerals-foundation-sale-amazon-8409924.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shoppers Say Their Skin Looks Airbrushed Thanks to This Foundation</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kelly-wearstler.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kelly Wearstler</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
