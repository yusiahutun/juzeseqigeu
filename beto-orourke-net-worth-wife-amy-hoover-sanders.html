Ted Cruz last year. Despite the loss, his Senate campaign raised $80.3 million, according to the Center for Public Integrity, the most a Senate candidate has ever raised in a single race.</p><h2 id=beto-orourke-net-worth-20>Beto Orourke Net Worth 2022 Update</h2><p>According to documents collected by the <a href=# rel=noopener>Center for Responsive Politics</a>, Beto O'Rourke had an estimated net worth of $8.95 million in 2015. In 2016, his net worth was estimated to be $3 million on Roll Call's Wealth of Congress list.</p><p>His and his wife's assets ranged from $3.5 million to over $16 million, according to a review of his financial declarations during the 2018 Senate campaign. Their liabilities range from $1.3 million to $5.7 million, mostly due to real estate assets.</p><p>[image-1]</p><p>In the late 1990s, O'Rourke launched Stanton Street Technology Group, a software and technology firm. When O'Rourke ran for Congress, his wife, Amy Sanders O'Rourke, took over the company but sold her stock in 2017 before he ran for Senate. According to court documents, the deal netted between $100,000 and $1 million.</p><p>O'Rourke was also a partner in Imperial Arms LLC, a real estate firm that owns a million-dollar rental property in El Paso. The property was sold by the O'Rourkes in early 2017.</p><h2 id=meet-beto-orourke-million>Meet Beto Orourke Millionaire Wife Amy Hoover Sanders&nbsp;</h2><p>Since 2005, Beto O'Rourke has been married to Anne Sanders. They have three children together. The New York Times described Beto's father-in-law, William Sanders, as a millionaire real estate developer in an October 2018 profile.</p><p>Following articles from <a href=# rel=noopener>celebrity net worth</a> magically assessed William's net worth to be $20 billion. That would be unexpected. We do not currently have a Celebrity Net Worth ranking for William Sanders, but if we did, he would not be a billionaire.</p><p>[image-2]</p><p>In 1966, William Sanders established the International Development Corp. He renamed the firm LaSalle Partners and moved it to Chicago in 1968. Over time, the company evolved into Jones Lang LaSalle, which it is today. Sanders sold his ownership in the company for $65 million in the 1980s or $165 million after inflation.</p><p>Sanders started a new company called Security Capital Group in Santa Fe a few years after selling his investment. By 2000, the Real Estate Investment Trust had amassed an estimated $25 billion in assets under management.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Does Carmel Tebbutt Have A New Partner?

Pat was outgoing and charismatic, but his kid was more introverted. Pat would nudge Beto, proposing that he make an introduction. According to O'Rourke,</p><p>It was the last thing I wanted to do with him because he was an awkward and shy youngster, but now he can look back and thank me for it.</p><p>Ray Caballero's successful 2001 mayoral campaign, whose platform fostered the concept that El Paso was magnificent, influenced O'Rourke.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Also, read:&nbsp;Who Is Greg Ellis's Ex-Wife?
