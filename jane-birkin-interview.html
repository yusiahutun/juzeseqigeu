That’s when a girl first dares to be her own age, show her bare face, and not just dress for boyfriends or husbands. I’ve kept all the old photos of myself from the ’60s, but I can’t relate to them now at all. All that dressing up! And the eye makeup! We looked like Barbie dolls.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On the other hand, being well-known because of those photos provided me with an extraordinary life. I could get away with murder. I could stroll right into the hottest nightclub in a long T-shirt and ballet flats, carrying my wicker basket, like I owned the place.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span></span>My mother, who was an actress, used to say, “Can’t you make an effort?” That was her thing—she used to change her clothes three times a day. But it wasn’t my thing. In fact, when I first went to Paris as a teenager, I could always spot other English girls because we put everything together so badly. Frenchwomen start with the same ingredients, but they make better use of them. They were always so beautifully turned out with their velvet headbands and clip-on pearls, a scarf casually tossed over their shoulder. But after the counterculture swept through Europe, it became chic to wear whatever you liked, and it was our chance to laugh at the French girls. You’d see photos of Julie Christie coming down her front steps wearing a raincoat over her pajamas with gum boots, spectacles perched at the end of her nose. It was so unpretentious—and so very English. It’s impossible to be stylish without confidence, you see.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I could stroll right into the hottest nightclub in a long T-shirt and ballet flats, carrying my wicker basket, like I owned the place."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I found my uniform about 20 years ago, and it hasn’t changed since. To me, there’s nothing more beautiful than a simple cashmere jersey paired with boyfriend jeans or trousers. I was never particularly into high heels, and always go back to my old Converse with the sheepskin linings that I put in myself. If someone tried to put me in a cocktail dress, I’d look quite ropy. I wear an old man’s smoking [tuxedo jacket] in the evenings, which, if you can get your hands on one, is definitely worth buying. You can wear it for years, even if it has holes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Other than the jacket, my look isn’t tailored at all because I don’t have the figure for it. I also hate shopping. My daughter Kate [Barry, from her marriage to the composer John Barry] used to take me on shopping sprees. After she died, I stayed at home and didn’t see anyone for a couple of years. Then my artistic director called and suggested that I start performing again. Music helped me escape; I didn’t have to think so much. And suddenly I knew what to do at night. Performing—and my best friend, Gabrielle—is what got me through the past four years. And my bulldog, Dolly! She’s a wonderful face to wake up to. She tries to raid the chocolate, and the next thing you know we’re watching the late-night news together.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I don’t wear a lot of makeup anymore. When you’re older you know what to hide and what to show. When you’re 16 you can wear as much makeup as you like, but when you’re my age it can make you look like a witch. It’s far more important that you smell delicious. I made my own fragrance—L’Air de Rien— with London perfumer Miller Harris. It smells like tobacco mixed with musk, neroli, and vanilla. Another tip I’d like to give women? Take calcium supplements. I was recently playing hide—and-seek with my grandchildren and I fell on the stairs. Women need to take care of their bones. That, and don’t ever run up the stairs in socks!</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"It’s impossible to be stylish without confidence, you see."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Growing older really is the strangest thing. I recently said to my daughter Lou Doillon, “It’s gone.” And she’s like, “What’s gone, Mum?” And I said, “My beauty.” It’s like you wake up one day and suddenly the outside doesn’t correspond to the inside anymore. I’ve adjusted my thinking a bit since then. The essential thing, I now think, is a good sense of humor. Thankfully, my girls have that too.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Aging is also liberating. If you see someone you think is beautiful, you can just come out and say it and no one thinks you’re making a pass. The other day I told my taxi driver that he had a beautiful nose. It was long and hooked, but to me it was beautiful. He nearly crashed the car.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jane Birkin’s latest album, <a data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VTDTFDV href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VTDTFDV data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Birkin Gainsbourg: Le Symphonique" data-vars-ga-product-id=a844c63b-146f-4e21-a49e-b60d393d1597 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VTDTFDV data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VTDTFDV data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand="Warner Classics" data-vars-ga-product-price=$18.92 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=4792c917-5c07-46a4-a0ce-817fc2043cf2 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Warner Classics" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Chamber Music" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Birkin Gainsbourg: Le Symphonique</a>, is out now.
