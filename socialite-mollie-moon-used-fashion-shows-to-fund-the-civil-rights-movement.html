A pharmacist by training and a veteran fundraiser, Moon paid meticulous attention to every detail of the events she hosted, because she believed guests could feel her level of care. The Waldorf, with its Art Deco luxury, had hosted European monarchs, diplomats, and New York’s white upper crust. Why should the Black American guests Moon was hosting on this evening expect anything less than the royal treatment?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Moon, wife of the former NAACP public relations director, Henry Lee Moon, understood that Black Americans were generous givers who loved to dress up for a good cause. Give them an opportunity to show out and the money would show up! <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ebonyfashionfair.com/assembled/history.html#:~:text=Ten%20cities%20were%20selected%20in,with%20DeKnight%20serving%20as%20commentator." data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ticket prices" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ticket prices</a> for the fair ranged from $3.50 to $12 (roughly $25 to $100 today) and came with a subscription to either Ebony or Jet magazine. Proceeds from the NYC show would go to the National Urban League, the interracial civil rights organization Moon’s guild supported through savvy fundraising campaigns and volunteer work. In cities from Washington, D.C., to Peoria, Illinois, powerbrokers like Moon hosted Ebony Fashion Fair events to fund local nonprofit organizations, racial justice causes, and HBCU scholarships.</p><img alt="mollie moon, founder of the national urban league, and film producer ismail merchant at the league's beaux arts ball at the waldorf astoria in new york city february 08, 1969 photo by jerry engelnew york post archives c nyp holdings, inc via getty images" title="Mollie Moon And Ismail Merchant At The Waldorf" width=4835 height=5971 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mollie-moon-at-waldorf-gettyimages-534080476-1614712198.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">New York Post Archives</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Mollie Moon, left.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-dressed-the-history-of-fas-29000690/episode/50-years-of-the-ebony-fashion-46765803/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="idea for the Fashion Fair" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">idea for the Fashion Fair</a> originated in New Orleans in 1956. Jessie Covington Dent, an accomplished pianist, a socialite, and the wife of Dillard University president Albert W. Dent, reached out to media mogul John H. Johnson of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-johnson-publishing-bankruptcy-20190409-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Johnson Publishing" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Johnson Publishing</a> about cohosting a fashion show fundraiser for Flint-Goodridge Hospital. That first show was such a success that Johnson and his wife, the fashionable and cosmopolitan Eunice Johnson, decided they should make it an annual touring fundraiser. Ripping “Fashion Fair” straight from Ebony magazine’s monthly column of the same name, Ebony Fashion Fair took shape under the leadership of Johnson Publishing’s home services director, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/02/16/514360992/meet-freda-deknight-a-hidden-figure-and-titan-of-african-american-food data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Freda DeKnight" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Freda DeKnight</a>. The rebranded traveling fashion extravaganza launched in 1958 with the theme Ebony Fashion Fair Around the Clock, featuring the wares of American and European designers, a few models, lively music, elaborate stage props, and colorful commentary by DeKnight.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Give them an opportunity to show out and the money would show up<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ebony Fashion Fair was the perfect fundraiser. “It was ready-made,” Joy Bivins, curator of “<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://fashionista.com/2013/03/vintage-couture-and-risky-diverse-mannequins-how-the-new-ebony-fashion-fair-exhibit-came-together data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Inspiring Beauty" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Inspiring Beauty</a>: 50 Years of Ebony Fashion Fair,” explains. “For the organizations, they don’t really have to do anything but bring the show. It’s a package deal.” And for the attendees, the shows created an opportunity to “get together and do what rich people do with each other: show off! But it had this philanthropic aspect to it that, in many ways, made it okay,” Bivins says. The shows also gave exposure and brought new clientele to Black ready-to-wear designers and milliners who were struggling to launch their careers <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://zora.medium.com/this-organization-made-history-for-black-talent-in-the-fashion-industry-ec15f49c5ad9 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="due to Jim Crow racism and cronyism" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">due to Jim Crow racism and cronyism</a> in the mainstream fashion world.</p><img alt="apr 20 1979, apr 27 1979 ebony fashion fair credit denver post denver post via getty images" title="Denver Post Archives" width=2293 height=2242 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-838585660-1614712167.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Denver Post</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>A model at the Ebony Fashion Fair in Denver, 1979</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By the time Moon brought the event to NYC in 1959, it was among the hottest Black social events in the country. That year—with an Around the World theme—the tour expanded to 51 cities in 31 states. Moon supervised as DeKnight and the Fashion Fair team transformed the Waldorf Astoria’s Grand Ballroom into a Black traveler’s paradise, replete with stage props that included hat boxes and luggage with the names of European destination cities fancifully written on them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Press coverage that ran in the Amsterdam News and the New York Age played up the exclusive nature of the event, dubbing the two-hour show a “one night only affair.” It was a massive show that featured 200 garments and more than 400 accessories personally selected by DeKnight. The models swayed and sashayed across the stage in haute couture garments by Arthur Jablow, Martier Raymond, Maggy Rouff, Harry Young , and others. With more than 3,000 people in attendance, the standing-room-only event was a roaring triumph. It further cemented Moon’s status as the grande dame of Black social and civic life in New York City.</p><img alt="apr 17 1978, apr 20 1978 ebony, fashion fair credit denver post denver post via getty images" title="Denver Post Archives" width=2502 height=1710 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-837924984-1614712104.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Denver Post</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Models at the Ebony Fashion Fair, Denver, Colorado, 1979</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fashion show fundraisers like the Ebony Fashion Fair were ubiquitous in the Black community during World War II and well into the Black Power movement era. The Fashion Fair reflected the Johnsons’ particular brand of Black cultural elitism, evident in the mink stoles, silk chiffon dresses, hand-beaded gowns, and dripping diamonds that were on display during the shows. But any crowd, regardless of income, taste level, or political leanings, could find a fashion show that catered to their interests and supported causes they could throw their hard-earned money behind.

Naturally’s Afro-sporting Grandassa Models wore African-inspired dresses and pantsuits, which they had designed and sewn themselves. Other community shows featured local folks—from maids to transit and postal workers—who modeled clothes from their closets. Styling out in garments of their own choosing affirmed that they were much more than uniform-wearing laborers. Churches, youth groups, sororities, and fraternities all found a sense of Black pride and Black economic self-help through fashion shows.</p><img alt="042204denver, co the denver chapter of the links, incorporated cq sponsored the annual ebony fashion fair cq this years theme is color splash cq photo by helen hrichardson photo by helen h richardsonthe denver post via getty images" title="04_22_04_DENVER, CO_ The Denver Chapter of The Links, Incorporated &amp;lt;cq&amp;gt; sponsored the annual &amp;quot;Ebony Fashion Fair.&amp;quot; &amp;lt;cq&amp;gt; This year&amp;apos;s theme is COLOR SPLASH &amp;lt;cq&amp;gt;.

Black, community-based giving circles and mutual aid societies can be traced to the Caribbean and West Africa in the 17th and 18th centuries, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/donors-of-color-are-not-new-or-emerging-weve-been-giving-all-along/?cid2=gen_login_refresh&cid=gen_sign_in" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Freeman explains" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Freeman explains</a>.
