She explained that she felt it was time to leave after founding real estate brokerage RealOpen with her husband, Christian Dumontet. Christine added that Jason Oppenheim was well aware of her plans to part ways with the company, so it should have been no surprise to him.</p><p>"I terminated my contract when the brokerage launched. I had to make a business decision that was for me, so I had to terminate the contract so I could move it over to my brokerage," Christine told <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p>She continued, "Jason knew. I told him. Him and I had had conversations a year prior. I told him I was doing my own thing…I think they thought I was bluffing; I don't think they actually thought I was working on a company, I don't know. But I told them for a year that I was working on this. Everyone knows. Jason and I, we have a really good understanding. I told him, 'This comes from a career move. I have to do my own thing.' So that's why I made the company."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9183b995-8f97-4ab7-92a3-04d3438301f8 data-container-ref=toofab:article:3fee190d-f495-4e01-bedc-8ebe516975e8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3b/5by4/2023/05/11/3bad0e5aae9a44f982abe82abe42964b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Selling Sunset's Chrishell Stause and G Flip Are Married in Surprise Announcement</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>2. Vanessa Villela</strong></p><p>After starring on Season 4 and 5 of "Selling Sunset," Vanessa Villela parted ways with the series. She explained that there were "definitely no hard feelings" and it was "a mutual decision," influenced by her move to The Agency, one of The Oppenheim Group's competitors.</p><p>"I am super excited to be back at The Agency. It's where my career started so it feels extremely good to be back. It feels like home," she told <a href=#>People</a>. "I came back because I'm very serious about where I want my real estate career to go. I know that this is where I have to be to succeed in real estate. It felt right, I always missed them. I feel in my heart it's where I belong. The minute I walked in, everyone welcomed me so beautifully."</p><p>The Agency happens to be featured on Netflix's "Buying Beverly Hills," so while Vanessa has left "Selling Sunset," it might not be the end of her reality TV career.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:88c7ea68-9d39-4d3a-8e02-3fa572326907 data-container-ref=toofab:article:3fee190d-f495-4e01-bedc-8ebe516975e8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e1/5by4/2023/05/04/e1afcc67106a41bfb42749b408bd75aa_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Netflix</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Bre Tiesi's Relationship With Nick Cannon Causes Drama on Selling Sunset in Season 6 Trailer</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>3. Maya Vander</strong></p><p>As an original star of "Selling Sunset," Maya Vander decided to depart the show after Season 5 wrapped. She explained that the difficult decision came shortly after suffering a miscarriage, which left her with a desire to spend more time at home with her family. Maya also shared that she wanted to focus on her new real estate group.</p><p>"So…I'm very proud of my Selling Sunset family for getting two more seasons and hopefully Emmy nomination. I decided not to go on with the show and it was not an easy decision! Being part of such a successful hit is absolutely amazing and I am so grateful for!!" she wrote in an Instagram story at the time.</p><p>She continued, "The last few months were not easy. Losing a baby at 38 weeks following a miscarriage is just too much to handle. I just want to be home with my husband and beautiful kids who I absolutely adore. Focusing on growing my Maya Vander Group and joining Compass is the right decision for me to move forward."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:51c4357c-c261-45fb-9dc8-ed166ab614c0 data-container-ref=toofab:article:3fee190d-f495-4e01-bedc-8ebe516975e8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c7/5by4/2023/03/31/c70986a288064305b3efc24051b255d6_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Heather Rae El Moussa Says Selling Sunset Hasn't Called For Season 7 After Maternity Leave</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>4. Davina Potratz</strong></p><p>Davina Potratz was a cast member on "Selling Sunset" from Seasons 2 to 5 but over the course of the past few years, fans have noticed that she hasn't been featured on the show nearly as much in the past. While she hasn't completely left the show, it appears she's no longer a main cast member. Davina hasn't spoken out about her position on the show, but when a fan <a href=#>questioned</a> her why her personality wasn't showcased on the series, she replied, "Ask the producers!"</p><p>Then, before the premiere of Season 6, one fan <a href=#>asked</a> Davina if she would be on the show, to which she wrote, "Just a little bit!" Once the new season debuted, many other fans reacted to her lack of airtime. Although she didn't clarify what was going on with her role on the show, she did show appreciation to those who wanted to see more of her.</p><a id=gallery-link-9b4db759-b247-4d79-aa60-73f522538452 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:9b4db759-b247-4d79-aa60-73f522538452 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:3fee190d-f495-4e01-bedc-8ebe516975e8 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b4/4by3/2022/03/12/b45e0a900fee4e2c89bf0f95dcf7652e_md.jpeg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29mamhflrmtedOhnGarpJa%2FtHnWoaZmoJGrsm64xJ%2BrZquVobmqusZmqq6mo5rBcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gambino-mob-grandson-john-gotti-questioned-federal-court-pizzeria-owner-s-torched-mercedes-benz-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gambino mob grandson John Gotti to be questioned over torched Mercedes Benz</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alan-jackson-daughter-ali-sings-youll-always-be-my-baby-2021.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alan Jackson's Duet With Daughter Ali Surprises Nashville Crowd</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
