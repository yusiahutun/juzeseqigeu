chewed through a can of deodorant which caused an explosion</p><p><span>A six-month-old puppy chomped through a can of deodorant which caused a window-shattering explosion.<br></span></p><p><span>The saluki greyhound cross called Zeus chewed through the can of Lynx and </span><span>caused a blast so intense that it shattered his owner's double glazed bay </span><span>window, broke the floorboards and set fire to the sofa.</span></p><p><span>Kerry Leech, 20, and her partner Matthew Heckler, 22, said they were lucky not </span><span>to have been in during the freak accident at their home in Goldthorpe, South </span><span>Yorkshire, on Saturday.</span></p><p><span>Firefighters first told the couple that the explosion must have been caused by </span><span>leaking gas pipes.</span></p><p><span>But after no evidence of a leak was found, they now believe that Zeus chewed</span><span> through the deodorant can right next to the home's back boiler, located </span><span>directly behind the living room fire.</span></p><p><span>When the central heating came on just minutes later, a spark ignited the gas </span><span>and caused the explosion.</span></p><p><span>Mr Heckler, who is currently unemployed, said: 'I didn't even know we had a can of </span><span>Lynx in the living room.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>'It was a Christmas present from Kerry's parents and was in a gift box </span><span>underneath a table - right next to the fire and back boiler.</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li
