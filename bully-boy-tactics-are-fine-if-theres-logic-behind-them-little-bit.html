Oh, and by the way, although Uber does a great deal of business it does not actually make any money; in fact last year it lost US$2.8 billion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to some people it doesn’t matter if the boss is an absolute a***hole because what counts is the bottom line, which, in the case of Uber seems to suggest that actually there is some cause for concern.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Arrogance, impetuousness and indeed even a bit of full throttle bullying can be tolerated if the people at the receiving end really believe that it has some purpose other than being nasty for the sake of nastiness</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a previous incarnation I used to cover the energy business, which brought me into contact with quite a large number of senior executives in the oil business, a notoriously male dominated, macho industry where the word ‘wimp’ was a big part of the vocabulary.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I had a particular problem with the CEO of one oil and gas company who made a habit of wagging a finger at me every time we talked. Finally, getting fed up with this, I asked him to stop finger wagging in my face; he was taken aback and informed me that was how he behaved with everyone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Of course this was not true because, like Kalanick, who can also turn on the charm when he needs to, these big macho company bosses only bully subordinates or people who they believe are somehow beholden to them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And here’s the problem, because in the business world, like every other world, what comes around, comes around. The person who was once a subordinate may well become a powerful business figure; the business partner who has been abused by a bullying CEO might one day be running a business that will be of great use to the bully.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I am delighted to report that this change in fortune affected the finger-wagger I mentioned earlier, who was eventually ‘let go’ after it was found that turnover among key people in the company was way too high and that other business partners, emboldened by a sudden decline in oil prices, took great pleasure in getting their own back when dealing with him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/21/9d1f7010-5638-11e7-839c-33f85c43b72e_1320x770_163110.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This may all sound rather petty and in some ways it is, but businesses are run by people, and not by machines, and so personality really does matter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet arrogance, impetuousness and indeed even a bit of full throttle bullying can be tolerated if the people at the receiving end really believe that it has some purpose other than being nasty for the sake of nastiness.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A famous example of a rather nasty but highly effective individual is Ray Kroc, the man who transformed McDonald’s into becoming one of the world’s most successful franchise operations (incidentally ‘The Founder’, a recent bio-pic about Kroc captures his personality quite wonderfully).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kroc cheated the McDonald’s founders, fell out with fellow executives on a routine basis and was, to put it mildly, abusive towards business partners.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet he had a core of very loyal people around him and his single-minded drive worked because although he had a habit of being rude and abrasive he was not gratuitously rude and abrasive; there was logic to what he was doing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Generally speaking however a little bit of politeness, even kindness and friendliness goes a long way in making businesses work.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Moreover it sustains long-term partnerships which yield impressive results over time. It may sound trite but my own business experience is precisely this and for every truly vile executive I have encountered, I can point to a dozen others who have achieved way better results without all the unnecessary agro.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That said maybe a vast ego, consistent bullying and an almost unending flow of insults can work in some circumstances, like the one which propelled a certain businessman right into the Oval Office.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">How long he stays there is open to debate and how effective he will actually turn out to be is the subject of a torrent of speculation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Stephen Vines runs companies in the food sector and moonlights as a journalist and a broadcaster</strong></p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: A matter of kindness</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtflr%2B1tcKlnGhqYG6GdH%2BQaJmupJyueqO72GarmpuknrC0ecCrnGaemaOybrXFZquhnaKawG64zqCgnGWSmrWqusNmq6GdnWK5qsDTpZxmmpmp</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./weird-tricks-to-get-dewy-skin.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Weird Tricks to Get Dewy Skin</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lifestyle-homes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lifestyle &amp;amp; homes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
