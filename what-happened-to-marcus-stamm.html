To explore the world a little, the then 22-year-old decided to head over to South America—Bolivia, to be specific.</p><p>While hanging out in La Paz, Bolivia’s capital, a stranger named Karl Ruprechter requested Yossi to join him on an exploration journey to the Amazon forest. Karl claimed that he was a geologist looking for the next gold mine.</p><p>Upon deciding to go on the trip, Yossi persuaded two other friends of his that he’d met in Bolivia earlier. These were Marcus Stamm(a teacher from Switzerland) and Kevin Gale, who was an American photographer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Together, the four men kicked off the journey into the Amazon. They passed by a village full of warm and inviting people who gave them food and other supplies for the trip. They also tried to talk the explorers out of going into the Amazon forest, claiming it abounded with danger.</p><p>Needless to say, they disregarded the warnings and kept going.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Beginning of Trouble</h2><p>After packing enough food and supplies in their backpacks, the explorers headed deep into the jungle. They trekked for several days – enough to exhaust the food supplies they had carried. Thanks to the hunger and overbearing hikes, the group soon developed tensions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2021/03/jungle-expedition-timeline.jpg><p>At one point, the boys had to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">kill monkeys to survive</a>. None of them liked the idea, but the will to survive pushed them. Unless you are a high PSR candidate on <a href=#>“Naked and Afraid</a>,” the mere thought of eating primates might give you shivers…</p><p>“We were constantly hungry. We would walk long days, having eaten nothing at all. We shot at monkeys and ate them. I would have put anything in my mouth. If you’d offered me human flesh, I wouldn’t have refused to indulge. When you get that hungry, nothing is disgusting.” Yossi said.</p><p><a title="ConversationPrints Amazon Rainforest Glossy Poster Picture Photo rain Forest Jungle Leaf Green" data-amazonimages href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611KCOnvQ4L.jpg alt="ConversationPrints Amazon Rainforest Glossy Poster Picture Photo rain Forest Jungle Leaf Green" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto title="What Happened to Marcus Stamm? 3"></a></p><p>In addition to being hungry and tired, Yossi and his friends also discovered that Karl wasn’t really a geologist as he had claimed to be.</p><p>Instead, he was a treasure hunter and scammer from Australia who had no idea how to navigate the jungle, let alone swim. The boys were in real trouble.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Happened To Marcus Stamm?</h2><p>There are all kinds of Marcus Stamm theories regarding what happened to him, but according to first-eye witness accounts, when the boys discovered that Karl wasn’t who he said he was, the new discoveries, the group split into two.</p><p>By this point, Marcus Stamm, the Swiss teacher, had grown trench foot. As a result, he could hardly keep up with the rest of the gang. Two weeks in, the group hadn’t located any gold mine or tribe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611KCOnvQ4L.jpg><p>Yossi and Kevin opted to make a temporary raft and head to the Tuichi River. They asked Marcus and Karl to go back on foot. Whether they made it back to civilization or not, we aren’t sure.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What about Yossi and Kevin?</h2><p>As the boys made their way to the river via the makeshift raft, they had no idea more&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trouble</a>&nbsp;awaited them. After sailing for a while, the two came face to face with a huge current.</p><p>Kevin noticed the current and jumped off the raft. He then swam to shore. Yossi, on the other hand, wasn’t so lucky.</p><p>The current swept him and threw him over the waterfall and into a canyon. He fought so hard and kept afloat until the waters had calmed down. He then swam to shore only to realize he was all alone, hungry, exhausted, and scared.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the next 20 days, the 22-year old held on to life by a thread. He once encountered a wild boar ready to tear him apart. To save his life, he made a run for it, deep into the rainforest, and shook the animal off.</p><p><a title="JAGUAR FACE GROWL poster BEAUTIFUL spotted coat SHARP teeth FIERCE 24X36" data-amazonimages href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51WwXUF2jkL.jpg alt="JAGUAR FACE GROWL poster BEAUTIFUL spotted coat SHARP teeth FIERCE 24X36" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto title="What Happened to Marcus Stamm? 5"></a></p><p>Yossi also fought a jaguar charging at him one of the days. His instinct told him to light up a mosquito repellent and create a flamethrower to wade the jaguar off. It worked.</p><p>The Israeli military captain also woke up with aches and pain all over his body one day only to realize he had spent the night on a termite nest. His feet had become so infected that they were essentially fleshy and painful.</p><p>So much more happened while in the jungle, but after 20 days, his friend Kevin alongside other people, rescued him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>The survival story of Yossi Ghinsberg, Marcus, Karl, and Kevin caught the world’s attention that Hollywood had to make a movie about it called “Jungle,” starring Daniel Radcliffe of&nbsp;Happy Potter&nbsp;fame.</p><p><a title="Jungle: A Harrowing True Story of Survival in the Amazon" data-amazonimages href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51iQhEe-I6L.jpg alt="Jungle: A Harrowing True Story of Survival in the Amazon" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto title="What Happened to Marcus Stamm? 6"></a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Yossi’s book about his adventures</a> is also a best-seller. The 61-year has since gone back to Bolivia to thank his rescuers and visited many countries to tell his story.&nbsp;</p><p>So, was Marcus Stamm found? Unfortunately, he has been M.I.A. since the encounter. We sure hope he’s okay!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmsKCRqXqprc%2BpnKedlGLBsHnMmqmcraNiwLWtzKZm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eugenie-devane-husband-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>William Devanes wife Eugenie Devane Biography &amp;amp; Personal Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ree-drummond-new-home-photos-oklahoma-house-pictures.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ree Drummond New Home Photos: Oklahoma House Pictures</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
