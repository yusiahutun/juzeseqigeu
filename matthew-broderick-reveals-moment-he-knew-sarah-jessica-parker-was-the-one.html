When? How? Who?" Broderick joked before sweetly saying: "Oh that she was the one to marry...?" Which elicited a quick "yes!" from his host.</p><p>"Oh, the first time I met her," the '80s icon explained. "I saw her walking down the street and thought 'That's it.'"</p><p>When asked what was the best gift SJP ever gave him, he answered: "A trip once.

Andy probed.</p><p>"I wish I had a witty answer to that," Broderick said. "Um, I like just some plain old, some dinner."</p><p>As Andy tried to plow ahead, Broderick joked of his answer about favorite date night "I'm fun huh?"</p><p>To the question of what he most admires about his wife he said: "Humor and wisdom."</p><p>But then Cohen went immediately from there into the juicy stuff, asking him if any of his onscreen romantic moments with another actress made SJP jealous. Broderick answered he didn't know.</p><p>When Cohen then asked if any of her love scenes made him uncomfortable, he said: "Yeah not really. Maybe occasionally, but it doesn't really bother me. I know what that's like."</p><p>SJP and Broderick have been married for going on a quarter century. They share three children together.</p><p>See how SJP answered a similar round of questions a couple months prior on WWHL:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j21ma21foq61wMeermaaoqSxpr7InKJmqpWrsqK40makqKWVo8FutMRmoqedp2LAor7AoWSjnaOotqStjKmYq6OVp3q4rdJmq6GdXaS7pns%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./remember-when-dwight-yoakam-played-grocery-store-employee-ellen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Remember When Dwight Yoakam Helped Make Television History?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1000-lb-sisters-how-old-are-tammy-and-amy-slaton-in-2021-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Old Are Tammy and Amy Slaton in 2021?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oliver-bonas-ss18-homeware-buys.html>10 pieces you'll love from Oliver Bonas' new homeware collection</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./12-facts-about-jasper-steven-universe.html>12 Facts About Jasper (Steven Universe)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./joshua-kushner-his-familys-first-billionaire-not-jared.html>Joshua Kushner is his familys first billionaire not Jared: how Karlie Kloss husband and Iv</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pros-cons-pci-e-wireless-adapter-vs-usb-wireless-solution.html>The Pros and Cons of PCI-e Wireless Network Adapters vs. USB Wireless Solutions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./discrete-manufacturing-and-how-it-is-useful.html>What is Discrete Manufacturing and how it is useful?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest.
